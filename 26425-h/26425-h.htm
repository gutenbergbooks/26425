<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>It may be reasonably asked why Dr. Bliss's<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> edition of the
Microcosmography should require a preface, and the answer is that it does
not require one. It would be difficult to have a more scholarly, more
adequate, more self-sufficing edition of a favourite book. Almost
everything that helps the elucidation of the text, almost everything about
Bishop Earle that could heighten our affection for him (there is nothing
known to his disparagement) is to be found here.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> And affection for the
editor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span> is conciliated by the way. It is not only his standard of
equipment that secures this&mdash;a standard that might have satisfied Mark
Pattison<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>&mdash;but also the painstaking love revealed in it, which, like
every other true love, whether of men or books, will not give of that
which costs it nothing. And, as a further title to our regard, Dr. Bliss
is amusing at his own expense, and compares himself to Earle's "critic,"
who swells books into folios with his comments. Not that this humorous
self-depreciation is to be pressed; for, unlike that critic, he is no
"troublesome vexer of the dead."</p>

<p>But though there is no need of a preface, I have two excuses for writing
one.</p>

<p>The first is that I was asked to do it by my friend Mr. Frank George, of
Bristol, who wished to see the book reprinted; and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span> second is the old
<i>professio pietatis</i>, which seemed to Tacitus a sufficient defence of the
Agricola, and may perhaps be allowed to serve humbler people as well. What
Earle says of men is no less true of books: "Acquaintance is the first
draught of a friend. Men take a degree in our respect till at last they
wholly possess us;" and the history of this possession must, in every
case, have a sort of interest, as long as it is not carried to the point
of demanding from others the superlatives we permit to ourselves. It is
sufficiently common for people to like the same book for different
reasons; and where an author has a secure place in English literature, his
shade, like the deity of Utopia, may be best pleased with a manifold and
various worship.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>The character of Earle, as drawn by Clarendon, is itself a guarantee for
his studies of character; and the fact that Lord Falkland was his chosen
friend is evidence of his possessing something of that sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
reasonableness of temper for which his host was so remarkable. "He was
very dear" (we are told) "to the Lord Falkland, with whom he spent as much
time as he could make his own." Indeed, "Mr. Earles would frequently
profess that he had got more useful learning by his conversation at Tew
than he had at Oxford." Of Earle's conversation Clarendon says that it was
"so pleasant and delightful, so very innocent and so very facetious, that
no man's company was more desired and more loved." Walton, too, tells us
of his "innocent wisdom and sanctified learning"; and another witness
speaks of his "charitable heart," an epithet which is nobly borne out by
the correspondence between himself and Baxter printed in this volume.</p>

<p>This is no superfluous citation of testimony. Without it we might,
perhaps, have suspected, though not, I think, legitimately, something
almost of a cynical spirit in the severity of the punishment which he
deals out to the various disguises of vice and imposture, and in the
pitiless nakedness in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span> which he leaves them. But there are even stronger
reasons for recalling contemporary verdicts pronounced on Earle as a man.
Hallam, in the "Literature of Europe,"<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> has a short notice of him, and
though it shews some appreciation of his ability, it contains a very
unworthy aspersion on his character. "The chapter on the sceptic," he
says, "is witty, but an insult to the honest searcher after truth, which
could only have come from one that was content to take up his own opinions
for ease or profit." If we accept all that is said of Earle's piety and
devotion, and give its proper weight to the very significant epithet
"innocent," used both by Walton and Clarendon, we shall, I think, be slow
to suspect his motive in attacking the sceptic. The honest doubter, it
must be remembered, was not the familiar&mdash;much less the
fashionable&mdash;figure he has become since, and it is very certain that Earle
described one type of sceptic both of his day and our own. That his sketch
may have done injustice to other types is likely enough;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span> but that is no
reason for calling in question the sincerity of his opinions, or
attributing an interested orthodoxy to one whom Bunyan might have
christened Mr. Singleheart. The piety of the 17th Century was not disposed
to be gentle to sceptics. Even Bacon's enlightenment allows itself harsher
language on such subjects than any to be found in Earle. "None do refuse
to believe in a God save those for <i>whom it maketh that there were no
God</i>." And if Bacon is not thought a satisfactory witness, we have an
unimpeachable one very much nearer to our time. Dr. Johnson's occasional
strictures on sceptics are well-known, but his reputation for honest
thinking has never been impaired by their severity. Earle knew what
charity was, as the Baxter correspondence shows, and he has exposed in one
of his characters "the faith that has no room for it"; and if his own
faith needed further enlargement in the case of a sceptic,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> some
enlargement of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span> Hallam's charity might also have been looked for in
dealing with the earnestness of a militant piety.</p>

<p>The character-sketch is naturally a thing of limited scope. "Fine
portraiture,"<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> it has been said, "is not possible under such conditions
as it imposes. The traits, common to a class, cannot at the same time be
the accurate and intimate likeness of an individual. For this, a simple
enumeration of actions which such and such a man will do, is not enough. A
novelist takes a long series of connected actions, and even then he has to
interpret, to review from time to time whole stages of development." All
this is, no doubt, true, but the character-writers differ to a remarkable
extent in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span> their individualising power&mdash;some of them achieving a high
degree of success, as is subsequently admitted in the case of Thackeray by
the writer just quoted. It may be noticed too, by the way, that great
novelists are not always equally successful in the character-sketch. One
is reminded of Johnson's phrase about Milton's inability "to carve heads
upon cherry stones" when one thinks of "Theophrastus Such" on the one
hand, and the almost unique position of George Eliot as a novelist on the
other. Less successful as she often is in lightness of touch when she has
to pause and interpret her story, she had not prepared us for such a
complete exhaustion of power as her attempt in this branch of literature
(apparently of the same genus, almost of the same species, as the novel)
reveals to her disappointed admirers. It may, at any rate, be said that
her failure is an instructive lesson in the literary division of labour,
and that these studies require a peculiar delicacy of organisation in the
observer, as well as a special gift of exposition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dolus latet in generalibus" is a salutary warning, but the
character-writers, as a whole, have in most instances got creditably out
of the snare, while Earle, I think, has achieved something more. Besides
his humour and acuteness, besides even his profundity, I find in him an
exceptional power of individualizing. "The contemplative man," for
instance, belongs to a small class at all times; but it is only an
individual we have known, and known at rare intervals, of whose
Wordsworthian temper we are able to say that "Nature asks his approbation
as it were of her works and variety." Again, "the grave divine, who is not
yet dean or canon, though his life is our religion's best apology," reads
throughout like a personal experience. I at least so read it, or I should
not have borrowed from Earle for the dedication which stands at the head
of this preface. Yet such identifications are usually reserved for the
great novelist, whose highest art, as Macaulay says, is to "make the
inventions of one man seem like the recollections of another."</p>

<p>Some of Earle's readers appear to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span> chiefly impressed with his book as
furnishing "a picturesque idea of a period now remote, and as possessing
much of the affected quaintness of its age."<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> The picturesqueness I
find, and a good deal of quaintness; but the total impression is that of a
man who has got beyond words, ancient or modern, in his studies of human
nature&mdash;of one who, whether</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"invectively he pierceth through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The body of the country, city, court;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or is "anatomizing the wise man's folly," is as instructive a moralist in
the end of the nineteenth century as in the beginning of the seventeenth.
This, in a sense, is true of all great moralists, but the distinction of
Earle, as I understand it, is that his characters are so often really
people of our own day, with idiosyncracies that seem almost more
applicable to our own age than to his.</p>

<p>Society is almost a technical term to-day, susceptible, one would have
said, of refinements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span> of difference infinitely more various than anything
that could have existed more than two hundred years ago; yet one cannot
but feel that this observer would have been fully equal to drawing our
microcosm as well as his own. Earle's is a penetrating observation which
is always fresh&mdash;so fresh that no archaism of phrase in him, and no cheery
optimism in ourselves, can disguise the fact that it is our weaknesses he
is probing, our motives he is discovering.</p>

<p>There are still with us "those well-behaved ghosts &AElig;neas met with&mdash;friends
to talk with, and men to look on, but if he grasped them but air"&mdash;those
shadowy creatures that "wonder at your ill-breeding,<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> that cannot
distinguish between what is spoken and what is meant."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span></p>

<p>We are no strangers to "the fashionable respect which loves not deeper
mutualities, but though exceeding kind and friendly at your first
acquaintance, is at the twentieth meeting but friendly still"; or to that
similar temper which "nothing so much puts out as to trespass against the
genteel way." And, to go a stage lower, the formal man still survives,
whose "face is in so good a frame because he is not disjointed with other
meditations&mdash;who hath staid in the world to fill a number; and when he is
gone there wants one and there's an end."<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> He, to be sure, has no
conversation, and that is his discretion&mdash;but others display then as now a
bolder discretion, and in their talk "fly for sanctuary rather to nonsense
which few descry, than to nothing which all."</p>

<p>But literary conversation is not forgotten.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span> It may be a stretch beyond
the power of a latter-day imagination to fancy a visitor proposing to
fascinate his company by some "scatterings of Seneca and Tacitus," or even
to think ourselves back to a time when these "were good for all
occasions." Yet, those who say "Chaucer<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> for our money above all our
English poets because the voice has gone so," (or had we better substitute
Browning?),<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> are still common enough examples of those who desire to
acquire inexpensively the reputation of good taste.</p>

<p>And there is another variety of modern artificiality which is not spared
in this book. For the many forms of busy idleness, the worship of
organisation and system, and all the other hindrances to life properly
so-called,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span> which it has been the cherished labour of this age to
multiply, Earle would have had no reserve of patience. "The dull
physician," we are told, has no leisure <i>to be idle</i>, that is, to study.
"The grave divine," who has "studied to make his shoulders sufficient for
his burden, comes not up thrice a week into his pulpit because <i>he would
not be idle</i>"; whereas the commendation of the young raw preacher is that
"he speaks without book, and, indeed, he was never used to it."</p>

<p>We may justly boast of the superior humanity of our century; but few would
deny that the elaborate apparatus of modern philanthropy has too often
become an end in itself, and absorption in it a serious detriment to any
worthy preparation for the work of edifying. In the absence of leisure
pulpits will hardly furnish us with that "sincere erudition which can send
us clear and pure away unto a virtuous and happy life."<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> Nor is such a
loss compensated by an endless succession of services or even a whole
street of committee-rooms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span></p>

<p>One would not, however, wish to rest in negations or dwell in the last
resort on Earle's critical attitude. One feels that the delightful house
at Tew did not spend all or even its best strength on criticism. Earle may
have there pursued the method of verification and studied his characters
in the flesh. Perhaps he saw there "the staid man," and duly appraised
this specimen of "nature's geometry";<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> while his obvious gifts as a
rational peace-maker, if not much needed in such a company, would not be
overlooked by Lord Falkland. "The good old man," too is a portrait so
strongly individualized that I cannot help thinking some very personal
experience went to the making of it&mdash;experience of a sort that was sure to
be revived at Tew, where "so good a relick of the old times" was not
likely to be wanting. It was a house, at any rate, for the "modest man" to
whom, as to the poet Cowper, public appearances were so many penances; for
though the world may not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span> agree with Earle as to the degree in which this
quality sets off a man, there is no question of Lord Falkland's welcome of
the modest man, even if that grave divine "Mr. Earles," did not point out
this diffident guest as one who "had a piece of singularity," and, for all
his modesty, "scorned something."</p>

<p>And, as "the most polite and <i>accurate</i> men of the University of
Oxford"<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> were to be met with at Tew, we may further hope that Earle
there watched the social mellowing of the "downright scholar whose mind
was too much taken up with his mind,"<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> and strove to carry out his own
recommendation, "practising him in men, and brushing him over with good
company."</p>

<p>Symposium is a word that has been much abused and vulgarised of late, but
something like its true Platonic sense must have been realised by the
company at Lord Falkland's,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span> as they "examined and refined those grosser
propositions which laziness and consent made current in vulgar
conversation":<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> for a more Platonic programme it would be difficult to
conceive. The pattern of the ideal republic is, we know, laid up somewhere
in the heavens; but the republic of letters so far as it was represented,
must have been as near the ideal in that house as it ever was on earth.
And in this ideal one of Earle's characters already mentioned was not only
a natural but a necessary element. "The contemplative man" is solitary, we
are told, in company, but he would not be so in this company. "Outward
show, the stream, the people," were not taken seriously at Lord
Falkland's; and the man who "can spell heaven out of earth" would be the
centre of a rare group&mdash;men upon whose fresh and eager appetites
conversation that was "mysterious and inward" could not easily pall.</p>

<p>Bishop Berkeley is one of the very few men who could answer with any
plausibility<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span> to this last character of Earle's. But the marvellous
amenity of his social gifts brings him a little closer to the kindly race
of men than Earle thinks is usual with the contemplative student. In every
other point it is an accurate piece of portraiture.<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> Nature might well
ask approbation of her works and variety from a man who was ever feeding
his noble curiosity and never satisfying it. He, too, made a "ladder of
his observations to climb to God." He, too, was "free from vice, because
he had no occasion to employ it." "Such gifts," said the turbulent Bishop
Atterbury of him, "I did not think had been the portion of any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span> but
angels." After this it is no hyperbole to say, as Earle does of the
contemplative man, "He has learnt all can here be taught him, and comes
now to heaven to see more."</p>

<p>Though Clarendon does full justice to Earle's personal charm, he uses the
epithets "sharp and witty" to describe his published "discourses"; and the
piercing severity of his wit is illustrated everywhere in this book. It is
clear, however, from the sympathetic sketches that Earle's was no <i>nil
admirari</i> doctrine, and that while he saw grave need on all hands for men
to clear their mind of cant, and their company of those who live by it, he
had great store of affection for all that is noble or noble in the making.</p>

<p>The "modest man" and the high-spirited man" are opposite types, but there
is in both the worthy pursuit and the high ideal. Moreover, the second of
those characters reveals a power of pathos which Earle might have
developed with more opportunity.<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> "The child" whom "his father has writ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
as his own little story" is another indication of the same mood.</p>

<p>These sketches are full of suggestive melancholy&mdash;not the melancholy of
the misanthrope, but the true melancholy&mdash;the melancholy of
Virgil&mdash;<i>Invalidus etiamque tremens etiam inscius aevi.</i><a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></p>

<p>There is another character drawn with a most incisive pathos, though less
<i>Virgilian</i><a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> in its tone.</p>

<p>The poor man, "with whom even those that are not friends <i>for ends</i> love
not a dearness," and who, "with a great deal of virtue, obtains of himself
not to hate men," is a pathetic figure, but he is something more. He is a
sermon on human weakness, not drawn as some Iago might have drawn it with
exultant mockery, but with the painful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span> unflinching veracity of one who is
ashamed of himself and of his kind. When one thinks how often this
weakness is spoken of as if it were peculiar to the moneyed class or to
the uneducated, and how many people whom one knows act and think as if
poverty were a vice if not a crime, though they shrink from avowing it, so
unqualified an exposure indicates a conscience of no common sensitiveness.</p>

<p>Earle's wit and humour are deadly weapons, and it must be said that the
trades and professions are treated with scant indulgence. He can even
leave a mark like that of Junius when he has a mind. Thus the dull
physician is present at "some desperate recovery, and is slandered with
it, though he be guiltless"; and the attorney does not fear doomsday
because "he hopes he has a trick to reverse judgment!"</p>

<p>But though one would not ask on behalf of impostors or scoundrels for
suspension of sentence, one does wish for more than a single picture of
the young man "who sins to better his understanding." The companionship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
of one who by his 34th year "had so much dispatched the business of life
that the oldest rarely attain to that knowledge and the youngest enter not
the world with more innocence,"<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> might have induced Earle to pourtray
more than the weaknesses of immature manhood.</p>

<p>We could not, however, have missed this or the other pictures of
characterless persons whether young or "having attained no proficiency by
their stay in the world." Inexperience may fail to recognise them and
suffer for it; or the gilding of rank and fashion may win for such persons
a name in society above that which they deserve, and the moralist is bound
to unmask them. These studies nevertheless are somewhat sombre;<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a> and
there is something much lighter and pleasanter in his presentation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span> of
some not unfamiliar phases of manners. There is the self-complacency that
deals with itself like a "truant reader skipping over the harsh places";
the frank discourtesy that finds something vicious in the conventions and
"circumstance" of good breeding; the patronising insolence<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> that "with
much ado seems to recover your name"; the egoism of discontent that "has
an accustomed tenderness not to be crossed in its fancy"; or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span> lastly, that
affectation of reticence which is as modern as anything in the book,
though its illustrations look so remote. Where we meet with such a temper,
Earle's is still the right method&mdash;"we must deal with such a man as we do
with Hebrew letters, spell him backwards and read him!"</p>

<p>Despite all this searching analysis and the biting wit which accompanies
it, I cannot think the epithet cynical, which I have heard ascribed to
Earle, is defensible. There is a vast difference between recognising our
frailty which is a fact, and insisting that our nature is made up of
nothing else, which is not a fact. The severe critic and the cynic differ
chiefly in this: the first reports distressing facts, the second invents
disgraceful fictions; the one distrusts, the other insults our common
nature; and in doing justice to the possibilities of that nature, no one
has gone further than Earle in his "contemplative man."</p>

<p>Something may be said of Earle's style before this introduction is brought
to an end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not think it is uniformly conspicuous<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> for quaintness, or that
there is much that can be called affectation; though occasionally an
excess of brevity has proved too tempting, or the desire to individualize
runs away with him.</p>

<p>The following passages, taken at random from the Characters, seem to
contain phrases that we should be well content to use to-day if we had
thought of them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He sighs to see what innocence he hath outlived.</i></p>

<p><i>We look on old age for his sake as a more reverent thing.</i></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span></p>

<p><i>He has still something to distinguish him from a gentleman,
though his doublet cost more.</i></p>

<p><i>It is discourtesy in you to believe him.</i></p>

<p><i>An extraordinary man in ordinary things.</i></p>

<p><i>His businesses with his friends are to visit them.</i></p>

<p><i>The main ambition of his life is not to be discredited.</i></p>

<p><i>He preaches heresy if it comes in his way, though with a
mind I must needs say very orthodox.</i></p></div>

<p>These quotations have no very unfamiliar sound, nor much flavour of
archaism about them. And there are many more, surprisingly free from
conceits or other oddities, if we reflect that the book was written before
Dryden was born, or modern prose with its precision and balance even
thought of.</p>

<p>There is one very distinguishing mark set on Earle's characters, the
profundity of the analysis that accompanies the sketch. He lets us know
not only what the grave divine or the staid man looks like, but why they
are what they are, and all this without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span> turning his sketch into an essay.
This mistake Bishop Hall is inclined to make, and Butler actually makes.
The author of Hudibras, it seems, would have been too fortunate had he
known where his own happiness lay&mdash;to wit in that "sting" of verse, which
Cowper says prose neither has nor can have.</p>

<p>When one compares the essay in its beginnings with the essay as we know it
to-day, it is not difficult to understand the change of form in the
character sketch. "The Character of a Trimmer"<a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a> is a very powerful piece
of writing, containing some very fine things, but Halifax could not make
of it that finished piece of brevity which it would have become in Earle's
hands. Latin criticism has the right word for his work&mdash;"densus."<a name="FNanchor_AA_27" id="FNanchor_AA_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a> We
could not pack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span> the thinking closer if we wished. And yet if we do not
care to reason a type out, there are pictures enough unspoilt by
commentary.<a name="FNanchor_AB_28" id="FNanchor_AB_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_28" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a> Earle has some of that delightful suddenness of
illustration which Selden makes so captivating in his Table-Talk. At once
we are made to see likeness or unlikeness, we hear no comment on it; since
the artist desires no more moral than is to be looked for in his art.</p>

<p>When on the other hand Earle makes more of the reason of the thing, he<a name="FNanchor_AC_29" id="FNanchor_AC_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_29" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a>
is literally "swift and sententious"&mdash;he never takes the opportunity to
draw us into an instructive disquisition, or to assume airs of profundity.
And his passing hint as to the cause of what <i>we see</i> no more injures any
picture he may draw than Coleridge's prose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span> argument at the side of the
page destroys the imaginative spectacle in the Ancient Mariner.</p>

<p>Earle, it has been said, "is not so thoroughly at home with men of all
sorts and conditions as Overbury, who had probably seen far more of the
world."<a name="FNanchor_AD_30" id="FNanchor_AD_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_30" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a> However relatively true this may be, Earle's book [published
1628] gives evidence of an experience of men as wide as it is intimate&mdash;an
experience little short of marvellous in a resident Fellow of
twenty-seven, whose younger years were chiefly distinguished for "oratory,
poetry, and witty fancies."<a name="FNanchor_AE_31" id="FNanchor_AE_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_AE_31" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a> (Perhaps his youth may account for some of
that excessive severity in handling follies which is occasionally
noticeable.) The article in the "Dictionary of National Biography" gives a
somewhat different impression of Earle as an observer. "The sketches
throw," it says, "<i>the greatest light</i> upon the social condition of the
time." Now this is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span> possible for anyone to achieve whose vision
requires "the spectacles of books"; though with such help it is doubtless
possible to extend and improve on the observations of others, with human
nature as a constant quantity. But to be at home with one's contemporaries
and to record one's intimacy means to see with the eye as well as the
mind. The slow inductive method of personal contact is indispensable; and
no reasoning from first principles, no assimilating of secondhand
experience, with whatever touches of genius, can be mistaken for it.</p>

<p>It is not likely that the Registrar's house (his father's house) at York
added much to Earle's sketch-book; and we have to fall back on what
Clarendon says of his delightful conversation, and by implication, of his
delight in it. In the society of a University and in the life of a
University town there would be presented to an observer of his exceptional
penetration enough of the fusion or confusion of classes to furnish the
analytical powers with a tolerably wide field.</p>

<p>And Earle does not suffer by comparison<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span> with his rivals. "The concise
narrative manner"<a name="FNanchor_AF_32" id="FNanchor_AF_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_AF_32" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a> of Theophrastus, though in its way as humorously
informing as we find Plautus and Terence, and as we should have found the
New Comedy which they copied, leaves us a little cold from the looseness
or the connexion in the quasi-narrative: we rise a little unsatisfied from
the ingenious banquet of conversational scraps; we desire more. Overbury,
again, says less than Earle, and is more artificial in saying it. Butler
and Bishop Hall too directly suggest <i>the essay</i><a name="FNanchor_AG_33" id="FNanchor_AG_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_AG_33" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a> and the sermon. In no
one of them is brevity so obviously the soul of wit as it is in Earle; no
one of them is so humorously thoughtful, so lucid in conception, so
striking in phrase.</p>

<p>When one has reckoned up all these gifts, and all that his friends and
contemporaries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span> said of him, and remember also who and what these friends
were, one is not startled by the eulogistic epitaph in Merton College
Chapel; these words are as moving as they are strong:</p>


<p class='center'>Si nomen ejus necdum suboleat, Lector,<br />
Nomen ejus ut pretiosa unguenta;<br />
Johannes Earle Eboracensis.</p>


<p>But his own choicer Latin in the epitaph he wrote for the learned Peter
Heylin would serve no less well for himself; and the beautiful brevity of
its closing cadences has so much of the distinction of his English, and
puts so forcibly what Earle deserves to have said of him, that it may
fitly be the last word here:</p>


<p class='center'>Plura ejusmodi meditanti<br />
mors indixit silentium:<br />
ut sileatur<br />
efficere non potest.<br /></p>


<p class='right'>S.T.I.</p>

<p>Clifton, May, 1896.</p>

"common and unimportant" (??). (See Arber's reprint of Earle.) It is to

</div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_J_10" id="Footnote_J_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_J_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> We may compare Matthew Arnold's travelling companion ("Essays

murders, and who refused to be consoled by being reminded that though the
worst should happen, there would still be the old crush at the corner of
Fenchurch Street, and that he would not be missed: "the great mundane
movement would still go on!"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_R_18" id="Footnote_R_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_R_18"><span class="label">[R]</span></a> Between Earle himself and Berkeley there is much resemblance.
Of Berkeley too it would have been said&mdash;"a person certainly of the
sweetest and most obliging nature that lived in our age"; and this
resemblance extends beyond their social gifts or their cast of mind, even
to their language. Earle's "vulgar-spirited" man, with whom "to thrive is
to do well," recalls a famous passage in the Siris.
</p><p>
"He that hath not thought much about God, the human soul, and the <i>summum
bonum</i>, may indeed be a <i>thriving</i> earth-worm, but he will make a sorry
patriot, and a sorry statesman."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_T_20" id="Footnote_T_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_T_20"><span class="label">[T]</span></a> One may recall, too, the famous words of the Sophoclean Ajax
to his son in connection with Earle's phrases. "He is not come to his task
of melancholy," "he arrives not at the mischief of being wise," read like
a free translation of Soph. Ajax, II. 554 and 555.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_U_21" id="Footnote_U_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_U_21"><span class="label">[U]</span></a> Perhaps the simile in &AElig;n. viii. 408 and one or two other
places would justify us in calling this also Virgilian, as, indeed, one
may call most good things.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_V_22" id="Footnote_V_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_V_22"><span class="label">[V]</span></a> Clarendon&mdash;his character of Lord Falkland.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_W_23" id="Footnote_W_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_W_23"><span class="label">[W]</span></a> There are certain things not at all sombre applicable not
only to our day, but to our <i>hour</i>, <i>e.g.</i> "the poet (I regret to say he
is 'a pot poet,') now much employed in commendations of our navy"; or
this, "His father sent him to the University, because he heard there were
the best fencing and dancing schools there." If we substitute athletics of
some kind, we have a very modern reason for the existence of such things
as Universities accepted as sound by both parents and children. <i>cf.</i> too
Dr. Bliss's note on the serving-man, and its quotation, "An' a man have
not skill in the hawking and hunting languages nowadays, I'll not give a
rush for him!"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_X_24" id="Footnote_X_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_X_24"><span class="label">[X]</span></a> <i>cf.</i> Falconbridge in "King John":
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And if his name be George I'll call him Peter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For new-made honour doth forget men's names."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
It is this character which was the occasion of the most delightful of all
stories of absence of mind, and though, doubtless, familiar to many, I
cannot resist repeating it. The poet Rogers was looking at a new picture
in the National Gallery in company with a friend. Rogers was soon
satisfied, but his friend was still absorbed. "I say," said Rogers, "<i>that
fellow</i> [Earle's insolent man] was at Holland House again last night, and
he came up and asked me if my name was Rogers." "Yes," said the friend,
still intent on the picture, "<i>and was it</i>?</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_Y_25" id="Footnote_Y_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_Y_25"><span class="label">[Y]</span></a> The article in the "Dictionary of National Biography" lays
stress on the freedom from conceits in Earle's few poems at a time when
conceits were universal. The lines on Sir John Burroughs contain a couplet
which is wonderfully close to Wordsworth's "Happy Warrior":
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His rage was tempered well, no fear could daunt<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>His reason</i>, his <i>cold</i> blood was valiant."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>cf.</i> "Who in the heat of conflict keeps <i>the law</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2">In <i>calmness</i> made."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Earle's standard in poetry was high. "Dr. Earle would not allow Lord
Falkland to be a good poet though a Great Witt," yet many poets praised
his verses. Aubrey, who tells us of Earle's opinion, confirms it. "He
(Lord Falkland) writt not a smooth verse, but a great deal of sense."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_Z_26" id="Footnote_Z_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_Z_26"><span class="label">[Z]</span></a> "The Trimmer" is no doubt a political manifesto&mdash;but no
retreat from politics could have chastened Halifax's style into a
resemblance to Earle's; when the "Character" became a political weapon,
its literary identity was all but at an end. "The Trimmer" is commended by
Macaulay in his History, where it will be remembered he pays a tribute to
its "vivacity."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AA_27" id="Footnote_AA_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AA_27"><span class="label">[AA]</span></a> Quintilian uses it of Thucydides.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AB_28" id="Footnote_AB_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AB_28"><span class="label">[AB]</span></a> The "She precise hypocrite" is a striking example&mdash;one of
Earle's most humorous pieces.
</p><p>
<i>cf.</i> also "The plain country fellow."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AC_29" id="Footnote_AC_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AC_29"><span class="label">[AC]</span></a> The pictures, with the moral attached, are best seen in
places: in "The Tavern, the best theatre of natures"; in "The Bowl-alley,
an emblem of the world where some few justle in to the mistress fortune";
in Paul's Walk, "where all inventions are emptied and not a few pockets!"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AD_30" id="Footnote_AD_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AD_30"><span class="label">[AD]</span></a> Professor Jebb, preface to "The Characters of
Theophrastus."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AE_31" id="Footnote_AE_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AE_31"><span class="label">[AE]</span></a> Anthony Wood.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AG_33" id="Footnote_AG_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AG_33"><span class="label">[AG]</span></a> Professor Jebb justly replies to Hallam that if La Bruy&egrave;re
is far superior to Theophrastus the scope of the two writers makes the
comparison unfair. The difference between them may perhaps be expressed by
saying that an essay was the last thing that the master and the first
thing that the disciple was anxious to produce.</p></div>

<p class='center'>(1) <span class="smcap">The Durham MS.</span></p>

<p>In the Cathedral Library at Durham is a small bound volume which contains
forty-six of Earle's Characters, bearing date 1627<a name="FNanchor_AH_34" id="FNanchor_AH_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_AH_34" class="fnanchor">[AH]</a>,&mdash;the date of the
first edition being 1628. I was enabled by the kindness of Dr. Greenwell,
the Librarian, to take it away and examine it at leisure; and the courtesy
of the University Librarian, Dr. Fowler, furnished me with an exact
collation of the MS. versions with the printed text<a name="FNanchor_AI_35" id="FNanchor_AI_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_AI_35" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a> of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
forty-six Characters, the original of the contributions made by him to
"Notes and Queries," and referred to in the "Dictionary of National
Biography."</p>

<p>(2) I have printed, besides, some other versions quoted by Bliss from "Dr.
Bright's MS.," and incorporated in his annotated copy of his own book.
These are often the same with those of the Durham MS. I should mention
that though this annotated copy is in the Bodleian Library, the
Sub-Librarian, Mr. Falconer Madan, "knows of no 'Bright MS.,'<a name="FNanchor_AJ_36" id="FNanchor_AJ_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_AJ_36" class="fnanchor">[AJ]</a> nor
where Bliss's MS. with that name is." The copy in question contains so
much additional matter that I have added a few things from it, but my
space was necessarily limited; there is good evidence in it of Bliss's
statement that he had continued collecting materials for the book for
forty-four years after its publication. Moreover, in the "Bliss Sale
Catalogue" in the Bodleian there are some 530 books of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span> Characters
(including duplicates). I am myself in possession, as I believe, of a copy
of Bliss's edition which belonged to himself, and which is annotated by
himself and Haslewood.<a name="FNanchor_AK_37" id="FNanchor_AK_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_AK_37" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a> It contains a castrated title-page (originally
Bliss suppressed his name) and a notice of the book in the "Monthly
Review" of 1812.</p>

<p>(3) I have added a few "testimonies" to Earle from Anthony Wood and
others.</p>

<p>(4) I have printed three letters from Clarendon to Earle from the
"Clarendon State Papers," with short extracts from two others; as well as
two letters of Earle's from the Bodleian Library&mdash;interesting rather as
personal relics than as containing anything very significant. All that
relates to its author will, I believe, be acceptable to lovers of the
"Cosmography."</p>

<p>For this additional matter, as well as for other help and counsel, I am
indebted to Mr. Charles Firth, of Balliol College, Oxford, whose learning
is always at the service of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span> his friends, and who stands in no need of the
old injunction&mdash;"not to be reserved and caitiff in this part of goodness."</p>

<p>(5) From a notebook of Bliss's (in MS.) in my possession I have added a
few titles of Books of Characters.</p>

<p>I have retained in this Appendix the spelling I found. Bliss's text has,
with a few exceptions (possibly accidental), the modern spelling.</p>

<h2><a name="ADVERTISEMENT" id="ADVERTISEMENT"></a>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>


<p>The present edition of Bishop Earle's Characters was undertaken from an
idea that they were well worthy of republication, and that the present
period, when the productions of our early English writers are sought after
with an avidity hitherto unexampled, would be the most favourable for
their appearance.</p>

<p>The text has been taken from the edition of 1732, collated with the first
impression in 1628. The variations from the latter are thus
distinguished:&mdash;those words or passages which have been added since the
first edition are contained between brackets, [and printed in the common
type]; those which have received some alteration, are printed in <i>italic</i>,
and the passages, as they stand in the first edition, are always given in
a note.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span></p>

<p>For the Notes, Appendix, and Index, the editor is entirely answerable, and
although he is fully aware that many superfluities will be censured, many
omissions discovered, and many errors pointed out, he hopes that the
merits of the original author will, in a great measure, compensate for the
false judgment or neglect of his reviver.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PREFACE" id="THE_PREFACE"></a>THE PREFACE</h2>

<p class='center'>[TO THE EDITION OF 1732<a name="FNanchor_AL_38" id="FNanchor_AL_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_AL_38" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a>.]</p>


<p>This little book had six editions between 1628 and 1633, without any
author's name to recommend it: I have heard of an eighth in 1664. From
that of 33 this present edition is reprinted, without altering any thing
but the plain errors of the press, and the old pointing and spelling in
some places.</p>

<p>The language is generally easy, and proves our English tongue not to be so
very changeable as is commonly supposed; nay, sometimes the phrase seems a
little obscure, more by the mistakes of the printer than the distance of
time. Here and there we meet with a broad expression, and some characters
are far below others; nor is it to be expected that so great a variety of
portraits should all be drawn with equal excellence, though there are
scarce any without some masterly touches. The change of fashions
unavoidably casts a shade upon a few places, yet even those contain an
exact picture of the age wherein they were written, as the rest does of
mankind in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span> general: for reflections founded upon nature will be just in
the main, as long as men are men, though the particular instances of vice
and folly may be diversified. Paul's Walk is now no more, but then good
company adjourn to coffee-houses, and, at the reasonable fine of two or
three pence, throw away as much of their precious time as they find
troublesome.</p>

<p>Perhaps these valuable essays may be as acceptable to the public now as
they were at first; both for the entertainment of those who are already
experienced in the ways of mankind, and for the information of others who
would know the world the best way, that is&mdash;without trying it<a name="FNanchor_AM_39" id="FNanchor_AM_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM_39" class="fnanchor">[AM]</a>.</p>

<p>As this entertaining little book is become rather scarce, and is replete
with so much good sense and genuine humour, which, though in part adapted
to the times when it first appeared, seems, on the whole, by no means
inapplicable to any &aelig;ra of mankind, the editor conceives that there needs
little apology for the republication. A farther inducement is, his having,
from very good authority, lately discovered<a name="FNanchor_AO_41" id="FNanchor_AO_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO_41" class="fnanchor">[AO]</a> that these <i>Characters</i>
(hitherto known only under the title of <i>Blount's</i><a name="FNanchor_AP_42" id="FNanchor_AP_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_AP_42" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a>),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span> were actually
drawn by the able pencil of <span class="smcap">John Earle</span>, who was formerly bishop of Sarum,
having been translated to that see from Worcester, A.D. 1663, and died at
Oxford, 1665.</p>

<p>Isaac Walton, in his Life of Hooker, delineates the character of the said
venerable prelate.</p>

<p>It appears from Antony Wood's Athen. Oxon. under the Life of Bishop Earle,
that this book was first of all published at London in 1628, under the
name of "<i>Edward Blount</i>."</p>

<h2><a name="EDITIONS_OF_MICROCOSMOGRAPHY" id="EDITIONS_OF_MICROCOSMOGRAPHY"></a>EDITIONS OF "MICROCOSMOGRAPHY."</h2>


<p>The first edition (of which the Bodleian possesses a copy, 8vo. P. 154.
Theol.) was printed with the following title: "<i>Microcosmographie: or, a
Peece of the World discovered; In Essayes and Characters. Newly composed
for the Northerne parts of this Kingdome. At London. Printed by W. S. for
Ed. Blount, 1628</i>." This contains only fifty-four characters<a name="FNanchor_AQ_43" id="FNanchor_AQ_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_AQ_43" class="fnanchor">[AQ]</a>, which in
the present edition are placed first. I am unable to speak of any
subsequent copy, till one in the following year, (1629), printed for
Robert Allot<a name="FNanchor_AR_44" id="FNanchor_AR_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_AR_44" class="fnanchor">[AR]</a>, and called in the title "<i>The first edition much
enlarged</i>." This, as Mr. Henry Ellis kindly informs me, from a copy in the
British Museum, possesses seventy-six characters. The <i>sixth</i> was printed
for Allot, in 1633, (<i>Bodl. Mar.</i> 441,) and has seventy-eight, the
additional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span> ones being "a herald," and "a suspicious, or jealous man." The
<i>seventh</i> appeared in 1638, for Andrew Crooke, agreeing precisely with the
sixth; and in 1650 the <i>eighth</i>. A copy of the latter is in the curious
library of Mr. Hill, and, as Mr. Park acquaints me, is without any
specific edition numbered in the title. I omit that noticed by the editor
of 1732, as printed in 1664, for if such a volume did exist, which I much
doubt, it was nothing more than a copy of the eighth with a new
title-page. In 1732 appeared the <i>ninth</i>, which was a reprint of the
<i>sixth</i>, executed with care and judgment. I have endeavoured in vain to
discover to whom we are indebted for this republication of bishop Earle's
curious volume, but it is probable that the person who undertook it, found
so little encouragement in his attempt to revive a taste for the
productions of our early writers, that he suffered his name to remain
unknown. Certain it is that the impression, probably not a large one, did
not sell speedily, as I have seen a copy, bearing date 1740, under the
name of "<i>The World display'd: or several Essays; consisting of the
various Characters and Passions of its principal Inhabitants</i>," &amp;c.
London, printed for C. Ward, and R. Chandler. The edition printed at
Salisbury, in 1786, (which has only seventy-four characters,) with that
now offered to the public, close the list.</p>

<p>I have (for once) adventured to play the midwife's part, helping to bring
forth these infants into the world, which the father would have smothered;
who having left them lapt up in loose sheets, as soon as his fancy was
delivered of them, written especially for his private recreation, to pass
away the time in the country, and by the forcible request of friends drawn
from him: yet, passing severally from hand to hand, in written copies,
grew at length to be a pretty number in a little volume: and among so many
sundry dispersed transcripts, some very imperfect and surreptitious had
liked to have passed the press, if the author had not used speedy means of
prevention; when, perceiving the hazard he ran to be wronged, was

was the son of Ralph Blount or Blunt, merchant-taylor of London; that he
was apprenticed to William Ponsonby, in 1578, and made free in 1588. It is
no slight honour to his taste and judgment, that he was one of the

<h3>A CHILD</h3>


<p>Is a man in a small letter, yet the best copy of Adam before he tasted of
Eve or the apple; and he is happy whose small practice in the world can
only write his character. He is nature's fresh picture newly drawn in oil,
which time, and much handling, dims and defaces. His soul is yet a white
paper<a name="FNanchor_1_49" id="FNanchor_1_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_49" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> unscribbled with observations of the world, wherewith, at length,
it becomes a blurred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> note-book. He is purely happy, because he knows no
evil, nor hath made means by sin to be acquainted with misery. He arrives
not at the mischief of being wise, nor endures evils to come, by
fore-seeing them. He kisses and loves all, and, when the smart of the rod
is past, smiles on his beater. Nature and his parents alike dandle him,
and tice him on with a bait of sugar to a draught of wormwood. He plays
yet, like a young prentice the first day, and is not come to his task of
melancholy. [<a name="FNanchor_2_50" id="FNanchor_2_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_50" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>All the language he speaks yet is tears, and they serve
him well enough to express his necessity.] His hardest labour is his
tongue, as if he were loath to use so deceitful an organ; and he is best
company with it when he can but prattle. We laugh at his foolish <a href="#ADDITIONAL_NOTES_AND_CORRECTIONS">ports</a>,</p>

<p>but his game is our earnest; and his drums, rattles, and hobby-horses, but
the emblems and mocking of man's business. His father hath writ him as his
own little story, wherein he reads those days of his life that he cannot
remember, and sighs to see what innocence he hath out-lived. The elder he
grows, he is a stair lower from God; and, like his first father, much
worse in his breeches.<a name="FNanchor_3_51" id="FNanchor_3_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_51" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He is the Christian's example, and the old man's
relapse; the one imitates his pureness, and the other falls into his
simplicity. Could he put off his body with his little coat, he had got
eternity without a burden, and exchanged but one heaven for another.</p>

<h3>A YOUNG RAW PREACHER</h3>


<p>Is a bird not yet fledged, that hath hopped out of his nest to be chirping
on a hedge, and will be straggling abroad at what peril soever. His
backwardness in the university hath set him thus forward; for had he not
truanted there, he had not been so hasty a divine. His small standing, and
time, hath made him a proficient only in boldness, out of which, and his
table-book, he is furnished for a preacher. His collections of study are
the notes of sermons, which, taken up at St. Mary's,<a name="FNanchor_4_52" id="FNanchor_4_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_52" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> he utters in the
country: and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> if he write brachigraphy,<a name="FNanchor_5_53" id="FNanchor_5_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_53" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> his stock is so much the
better. His writing is more than his reading, for he reads only what he
gets without book. Thus accomplished he comes down to his friends, and his
first salutation is grace and peace out of the pulpit. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> prayer is
conceited, and no man remembers his college more at large.<a name="FNanchor_6_54" id="FNanchor_6_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_54" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The pace of
his sermon is a full career, and he runs wildly over hill and dale, till
the clock stop him. The labour of it is chiefly in his lungs; and the only
thing he has made<a name="FNanchor_7_55" id="FNanchor_7_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_55" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> <i>in</i> it himself, is the faces. He takes on against
the pope without mercy, and has a jest still in lavender for Bellarmine:
yet he preaches heresy, if it comes in his way, though with a mind, I must
needs say, very orthodox.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> His action is all passion, and his speech
interjections. He has an excellent faculty in bemoaning the people, and
spits with a very good grace. [His stile is compounded of twenty several
men's, only his body imitates some one extraordinary.] He will not draw
his handkercher out of his place, nor blow his nose without discretion.
His commendation is, that he never looks upon book; and indeed he was
never used to it. He preaches but once a year, though twice on Sunday; for
the stuff is still the same, only the dressing a little altered: he has
more tricks with a sermon, than a taylor with an old cloak, to turn it,
and piece it, and at last quite disguise it with a new preface. If he have
waded farther in his profession, and would shew reading of his own, his
authors are postils, and his school-divinity a catechism. His fashion and
demure habit gets him in with some town-precisian, and makes him a guest
on Friday nights. You shall know him by his narrow velvet cape, and serge
facing; and his ruff, next his hair, the shortest thing about him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> The
companion of his walk is some zealous tradesman, whom he astonishes with
strange points, which they both understand alike. His friends and much
painfulness may prefer him to thirty pounds a year, and this means to a
chambermaid; with whom we leave him now in the bonds of wedlock:&mdash;next
Sunday you shall have him again.</p>

reign of Henry VII., who gave forty oaks towards the materials; and is, to

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_53" id="Footnote_5_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_53"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> <i>Brachigraphy</i>, or short-hand-writing, appears to have been
much studied in our author's time, and was probably esteemed a fashionable
accomplishment. It was first introduced into this country by Peter Bales,
who, in 1590, published <i>The Writing Schoolmaster</i>, a treatise consisting
of three parts, the first "of Brachygraphie, that is, to write as fast as
a man speaketh treatably, writing but one letter for a word;" the second,
of Orthography; and the third, of Calligraphy. Imprinted at London, by T.
Orwin, &amp;c. 1590. 4to. A second edition, "with sundry new additions,"
appeared in 1597. 12mo. Imprinted at London, by George Shawe, &amp;c.
Holinshed gives the following description of one of Bale's
performances:&mdash;"The tenth of August (1575,) a rare peece of worke, and
almost incredible, was brought to passe by an Englishman borne in the
citie of London, named Peter Bales, who by his industrie and practise of
his pen, contriued and writ within the compasse of a penie, in Latine, the
Lord's praier, the creed, the ten commandements, a praier to God, a praier
for the queene, his posie, his name, the daie of the moneth, the yeare of
our Lord, and the reigne of the queene. And on the seuenteenthe of August
next following, at Hampton court, he presented the same to the queene's
maiestie, in the head of a ring of gold, couered with a christall; and
presented therewith an excellent spectacle by him deuised, for the easier
reading thereof: wherewith hir maiestie read all that was written therein
with great admiration, and commended the same to the lords of the
councell, and the ambassadors, and did weare the same manie times vpon hir
finger." <i>Holinshed's Chronicle, page 1262, b. edit, folio, Lond. 1587.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_54" id="Footnote_6_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_54"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> It is customary in all sermons delivered before the
University, to use an introductory prayer for the founder of, and
principal benefactors to, the preacher's individual college, as well as
for the officers and members of the university in general. This, however,
would appear very ridiculous when "<i>he comes down to his friends</i>" or, in
other words, preaches before a country congregation.</p></div>

<h3>A GRAVE DIVINE</h3>


<p>Is one that knows the burthen of his calling, and hath studied to make his
shoulders sufficient; for which he hath not been hasty to launch forth of
his port, the university, but expected the ballast of learning, and the
wind of opportunity. Divinity is not the beginning but the end of his
studies; to which he takes the ordinary stair, and makes the arts his way.
He counts it not prophaneness to be polished with human reading, or to
smooth his way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> by Aristotle to school-divinity. He has sounded both
religions, and anchored in the best, and is a protestant out of judgment,
not faction; not because his country, but his reason is on this side. The
ministry is his choice, not refuge, and yet the pulpit not his itch, but
fear. His discourse is substance, not all rhetoric, and he utters more
things than words. His speech is not helped with inforced action, but the
matter acts itself. He shoots all his meditations at one but; and beats
upon his text, not the cushion; making his hearers, not the pulpit groan.
In citing of popish errors, he cuts them with arguments, not cudgels them
with barren invectives; and labours more to shew the truth of his cause
than the spleen. His sermon is limited by the method, not the hour-glass;
and his devotion goes along with him out of the pulpit. He comes not up
thrice a week, because he would not be idle; nor talks three hours
together, because he would not talk nothing: but his tongue preaches at
fit times, and his conversation is the every day's exercise. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> matters
of ceremony, he is not ceremonious, but thinks he owes that reverence to
the church to bow his judgement to it, and make more conscience of schism,
than a surplice. He esteems the church hierarchy as the church's glory,
and however we jar with Rome, would not have our confusion distinguish us.
In simoniacal purchases he thinks his soul goes in the bargain, and is
loath to come by promotion so dear; yet his worth at length advances him,
and the price of his own merit buys him a living. He is no base grater of
his tythes, and will not wrangle for the odd egg. The lawyer is the only
man he hinders, by whom he is spited for taking up quarrels. He is a main
pillar of our church, though not yet dean or canon, and his life our
religion's best apology. His death is the last sermon, where, in the
pulpit of his bed, he instructs men to die by his example.<a name="FNanchor_8_56" id="FNanchor_8_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_56" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<h3>A MEER DULL PHYSICIAN.</h3>


<p>His practice is some business at bedsides, and his speculation an urinal:
he is distinguished from an empiric, by a round velvet cap and doctor's
gown, yet no man takes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> degrees more superfluously, for he is doctor
howsoever. He is sworn to Galen and Hippocrates, as university men to
their statutes, though they never saw them; and his discourse is all
aphorisms, though his reading be only Alexis of Piedmont,<a name="FNanchor_9_57" id="FNanchor_9_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_57" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Regiment of Health.<a name="FNanchor_10_58" id="FNanchor_10_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_58" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The best cure he has done, is upon his own purse,
which from a lean sickliness he hath made lusty, and in flesh. His
learning consists much in reckoning up the hard names of diseases, and the
superscriptions of gally-pots in his apothecary's shop, which are ranked
in his shelves, and the doctor's memory. He is, indeed, only languaged in
diseases, and speaks Greek many times when he knows not. If he have been
but a by-stander at some desperate recovery, he is slandered with it
though he be guiltless; and this breeds his reputation, and that his
practice, for his skill is merely opinion. Of all odours he likes best the
smell of urine, and holds Vespasian's<a name="FNanchor_11_59" id="FNanchor_11_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_59" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> rule, that no gain is unsavory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
If you send this once to him you must resolve to be sick howsoever, for he
will never leave examining your water, till he has shaked it into a
disease:<a name="FNanchor_12_60" id="FNanchor_12_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_60" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> then follows a writ to his drugger in a strange tongue, which
he understands, though he cannot conster. If he see you himself, his
presence is the worst visitation: for if he cannot heal your sickness, he
will be sure to help it. He translates his apothecary's shop into your
chamber, and the very windows and benches must take physic. He tells you
your malady in Greek, though it be but a cold, or headach; which by good
endeavour and diligence he may bring to some moment indeed. His most
unfaithful act is, that he leaves a man gasping, and his pretence is,
death and he have a quarrel and must not meet; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> his fear is, lest the
carkass should bleed.<a name="FNanchor_13_61" id="FNanchor_13_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_61" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Anatomies, and other spectacles of mortality,
have hardened him, and he is no more struck with a funeral than a
grave-maker. Noble-men use him for a director of their stomach, and ladies
for wantonness,<a name="FNanchor_14_62" id="FNanchor_14_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_62" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> especially if he be a proper man.<a name="FNanchor_15_63" id="FNanchor_15_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_63" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> If he be single,
he is in league with his she-apothecary; and because it is the physician,
the husband is patient. If he have leisure to be idle (that is to study,)
he has a smatch at alcumy, and is sick of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> the philosopher's stone; a
disease uncurable, but by an abundant phlebotomy of the purse. His two
main opposites are a mountebank and a good woman, and he never shews his
learning so much as in an invective against them and their boxes. In
conclusion, he is a sucking consumption, and a very brother to the worms,

<h3>AN ALDERMAN.</h3>


<p>He is venerable in his gown, more in his beard, wherewith he sets not
forth so much his own, as the face of a city. You must look on him as one
of the town gates, and consider him not as a body, but a corporation. His
eminency above others hath made him a man of worship, for he had never
been preferred, but that he was worth thousands. He over-sees the
commonwealth, as his shop, and it is an argument of his policy, that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
has thriven by his craft. He is a rigorous magistrate in his ward; yet his
scale of justice is suspected, lest it be like the balances in his
warehouse. A ponderous man he is, and substantial, for his weight is
commonly extraordinary, and in his preferment nothing rises so much as his
belly. His head is of no great depth, yet well furnished; and when it is
in conjunction with his brethren, may bring forth a city apophthegm, or
some such sage matter. He is one that will not hastily run into error, for
he treads with great deliberation, and his judgment consists much in his
pace. His discourse is commonly the annals of his mayoralty, and what good
government there was in the days of his gold chain, though the door posts
were the only things that suffered reformation. He seems most sincerely
religious, especially on solemn days; for he comes often to church to make
a shew, [and is a part of the quire hangings.] He is the highest stair of
his profession, and an example to his trade, what in time they may come
to. He makes very much of his authority, but more of his sattin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> doublet,
which, though of good years, bears its age very well, and looks fresh
every Sunday: but his scarlet gown is a monument, and lasts from
generation to generation.</p>

<h3>A DISCONTENTED MAN</h3>


<p>Is one that is fallen out with the world, and will be revenged on himself.
Fortune has denied him in something, and he now takes pet, and will be
miserable in spite. The root of his disease is a self-humouring pride, and
an accustomed tenderness not to be crossed in his fancy; and the occasion
commonly of one of these three, a hard father, a peevish wench, or his
ambition thwarted. He considered not the nature of the world till he felt
it, and all blows fall on him heavier, because they light not first on his
expectation. He has now foregone all but his pride, and is yet
vain-glorious in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> ostentation of his melancholy. His composure of
himself is a studied carelessness, with his arms across, and a neglected
hanging of his head and cloak; and he is as great an enemy to an hat-band,
as fortune. He quarrels at the time and up-starts, and sighs at the
neglect of men of parts, that is, such as himself. His life is a perpetual
satyr, and he is still girding<a name="FNanchor_16_64" id="FNanchor_16_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_64" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the age's vanity, when this very anger
shews he too much esteems it. He is much displeased to see men merry, and
wonders what they can find to laugh at. He never draws his own lips higher
than a smile, and frowns wrinkle him before forty. He at last falls into
that deadly melancholy to be a bitter hater of men, and is the most apt
companion for any mischief. He is the spark that kindles the commonwealth,
and the bellows himself to blow it: and if he turn anything, it is
commonly one of these, either friar, traitor, or mad-man.</p>

<h3>AN ANTIQUARY;</h3>


<p>He is a man strangly thrifty of time past, and an enemy indeed to his maw,
whence he fetches out many things when they are now all rotten and
stinking. He is one that hath that unnatural disease to be enamoured of
old age and wrinkles, and loves all things (as Dutchmen do cheese,) the
better for being mouldy and worm-eaten. He is of our religion, because we
say it is most antient; and yet a broken statue would almost make him an
idolater. A great admirer he is of the rust of old monuments, and reads
only those characters, where time hath eaten out the letters. He will go
you forty miles to see a saint's well or a ruined abbey; and there be but
a cross or stone foot-stool in the way, he'll be considering it so long,
till he forget his journey. His estate consists much in shekels, and Roman
coins; and he hath more pictures of C&aelig;sar, than James or Elizabeth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Beggars cozen him with musty things which they have raked from dunghills,
and he preserves their rags for precious relicks. He loves no library, but
where there are more spiders volumes than authors, and looks with great
admiration on the antique work of cobwebs. Printed books he contemns, as a
novelty of this latter age, but a manuscript he pores on everlastingly,
especially if the cover be all moth-eaten, and the dust make a parenthesis
between every syllable. He would give all the books in his study (which
are rarities all,) for one of the old Roman binding, or six lines of Tully
in his own hand. His chamber is hung commonly with strange beasts skins,
and is a kind of charnel-house of bones extraordinary; and his discourse
upon them, if you will hear him, shall last longer. His very attire is
that which is the eldest out of fashion, [<a name="FNanchor_AW_65" id="FNanchor_AW_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_AW_65" class="fnanchor">[AW]</a><i>and you may pick a
criticism out of his breeches</i>.] He never looks upon himself till he is
grey-haired,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> and then he is pleased with his own antiquity. His grave
does not fright him, for he has been used to sepulchers, and he likes
death the better, because it gathers him to his fathers.</p>

<h3>A YOUNGER BROTHER.</h3>


<p>His elder brother was the Esau, that came out first and left him like
Jacob at his heels. His father has done with him, as Pharoah to the
children of Israel, that would have them make brick and give them no
straw, so he tasks him to be a gentleman, and leaves him nothing to
maintain it. The pride of his house has undone him, which the elder's
knighthood must sustain, and his beggary that knighthood. His birth and
bringing up will not suffer him to descend to the means to get wealth; but
he stands at the mercy of the world, and which is worse, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> his brother.
He is something better than the serving-men; yet they more saucy with him
than he bold with the master, who beholds him with a countenance of stern
awe, and checks him oftener than his liveries. His brother's old suits and
he are much alike in request, and cast off now and then one to the other.
Nature hath furnished him with a little more wit upon compassion, for it
is like to be his best revenue. If his annuity stretch so far, he is sent
to the university, and with great heart-burning takes upon him the
ministry, as a profession he is condemned to by his ill fortune. Others
take a more crooked path yet, the king's high-way; where at length their
vizard is plucked off, and they strike fair for Tyburn: but their
brother's pride, not love, gets them a pardon. His last refuge is the
Low-countries,<a name="FNanchor_17_66" id="FNanchor_17_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_66" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> rags and lice are no scandal, where he lives a
poor gentleman of a company, and dies without a shirt. The only thing that
may better his fortunes is an art he has to make a gentlewoman, wherewith
he baits now and then some rich widow that is hungry after his blood. He
is commonly discontented and desperate, and the form of his exclamation
is, <i>that churl my brother</i>. He loves not his country for this unnatural
custom, and would have long since revolted to the Spaniard, but for
Kent<a name="FNanchor_18_67" id="FNanchor_18_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_67" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> only, which he holds in admiration.</p>

<h3>A MEER FORMAL MAN</h3>


<p>Is somewhat more than the shape of a man; for he has his length, breadth,
and colour. When you have seen his outside, you have looked through him,
and need employ your discovery no farther. His reason is merely example,
and his action is not guided by his understanding, but he sees other men
do thus, and he follows them. He is a negative, for we cannot call him a
wise man, but not a fool; nor an honest man, but not a knave; nor a
protestant, but not a papist. The chief burden of his brain is the
carriage of his body and the setting of his face in a good frame; which he
performs the better, because he is not disjointed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> with other meditations.
His religion is a good quiet subject, and he prays as he swears, in the
phrase of the land. He is a fair guest, and a fair inviter, and can excuse
his good cheer in the accustomed apology. He has some faculty in mangling
of a rabbit, and the distribution of his morsel to a neighbour's trencher.
He apprehends a jest by seeing men smile, and laughs orderly himself, when
it comes to his turn. His businesses with his friends are to visit them,
and whilst the business is no more, he can perform this well enough. His
discourse is the news that he hath gathered in his walk, and for other
matters his discretion is, that he will only what he can, that is, say
nothing. His life is like one that runs to the<a name="FNanchor_19_68" id="FNanchor_19_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_68" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>church-walk, to take a
turn or two, and so passes. He hath staid in the world to fill a number;
and when he is gone, there wants one, and there's an end.</p>

<h3>A CHURCH-PAPIST</h3>


<p>Is one that parts his religion betwixt his conscience and his purse, and
comes to church not to serve God but the king. The face of the law makes
him wear the mask of the gospel, which he uses not as a means to save his
soul, but charges. He loves Popery well, but is loth to lose by it; and
though he be something scared with the bulls of Rome, yet they are far
off, and he is struck with more terror at the apparitor. Once a month he
presents himself at the church, to keep off the church-warden, and brings
in his body to save his bail. He kneels with the congregation, but prays
by himself, and asks God forgiveness for coming thither. If he be forced
to stay out a sermon, he pulls his hat over his eyes, and frowns out the
hour; and when he comes home, thinks to make amends for this fault by
abusing the preacher. His main policy is to shift off the communion, for
which he is never unfurnished of a quarrel, and will be sure to be out of
charity at Easter;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> and indeed he lies not, for he has a quarrel to the
sacrament. He would make a bad martyr and good traveller, for his
conscience is so large he could never wander out of it; and in
Constantinople would be circumcised with a reservation. His wife is more
zealous and therefore more costly, and he bates her in tires<a name="FNanchor_20_69" id="FNanchor_20_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_69" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> what she
stands him in religion. But we leave him hatching plots against the state,
and expecting Spinola.<a name="FNanchor_21_70" id="FNanchor_21_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_70" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_70" id="Footnote_21_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_70"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> <i>Ambrose Spinola</i> was one of the most celebrated and
excellent commanders that Spain ever possessed: he was born, in 1569, of a
noble family, and distinguished himself through life in being opposed to
prince Maurice of Nassau, the greatest general of his age, by whom he was
ever regarded with admiration and respect. He died in 1630, owing to a
disadvantage sustained by his troops at the siege of Cassel, which was to
be entirely attributed to the imprudent orders he received from Spain, and
which that government compelled him to obey. This disaster broke his
heart; and he died with the exclamation of "<i>they have robbed me of my
honour</i>;" an idea he was unable to survive. It is probable that, at the
time this character was composed, many of the disaffected in England were
in expectation of an attack to be made on this country by the Spaniards,
under the command of Spinola.</p></div>

<h3>A SELF-CONCEITED MAN</h3>


<p>Is one that knows himself so well, that he does not know himself. Two
excellent well-dones have undone him, and he is guilty of it that first
commended him to madness. He is now become his own book, which he pores on
continually, yet like a truant reader skips over the harsh places, and
surveys only that which is pleasant. In the speculation of his own good
parts, his eyes, like a drunkard's, see all double, and his fancy, like an
old man's spectacles, make a great letter in a small print. He imagines
every place where he comes his theater, and not a look stirring but his
spectator; and conceives men's thoughts to be very idle, that is, [only]
busy about him. His walk is still in the fashion of a march, and like his
opinion unaccompanied, with his eyes most fixed upon his own person, or on
others with reflection to himself. If he have done any thing that has past
with applause, he is always re-acting it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> alone, and conceits the extasy
his hearers were in at every period. His discourse is all positions and
definitive decrees, with <i>thus it must be</i> and <i>thus it is</i>, and he will
not humble his authority to prove it. His tenent is always singular and
aloof from the vulgar as he can, from which you must not hope to wrest
him. He has an excellent humour for an heretick, and in these days made
the first Arminian. He prefers Ramus before Aristotle, and Paracelsus
before Galen,<a name="FNanchor_22_71" id="FNanchor_22_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_71" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> [<i>and whosoever with most paradox is commended</i>.] He
much pities the world that has no more insight in his parts, when he is
too well discovered even to this very thought. A flatterer is a dunce to
him, for he can tell him nothing but what he knows before: and yet he
loves him too, because he is like himself. Men are merciful to him, and
let him alone, for if he be once driven from his humour, he is like two
inward friends fallen out: his own bitter enemy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> discontent presently
makes a murder. In sum, he is a bladder blown up with wind, which the
least flaw crushes to nothing.</p>

<h3>A TOO IDLY RESERVED MAN</h3>


<p>Is one that is a fool with discretion, or a strange piece of politician,
that manages the state of himself. His actions are his privy-council,
wherein no man must partake beside. He speaks under rule and prescription,
and dare not shew his teeth without Machiavel. He converses with his
neighbours as he would in Spain, and fears an inquisitive man as much as
the inquisition. He suspects all questions for examinations, and thinks
you would pick something out of him, and avoids you. His breast is like a
gentlewoman's closet, which locks up every toy or trifle, or some bragging
mountebank that makes every stinking thing a secret.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> He delivers you
common matters with great conjuration of silence, and whispers you in the
ear acts of parliament. You may as soon wrest a tooth from him as a paper,
and whatsoever he reads is letters. He dares not talk of great men for
fear of bad comments, and <i>he knows not how his words may be misapplied</i>.
Ask his opinion, and he tells you his doubt; and he never hears any thing
more astonishedly than what he knows before. His words are like the cards
at primivist,<a name="FNanchor_23_72" id="FNanchor_23_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_72" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> where 6 is 18, and 7, 21; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> they never signify what
they sound; but if he tell you he will do a thing, it is as much as if he
swore he would not. He is one, indeed, that takes all men to be craftier
than they are, and puts himself to a great deal of affliction to hinder
their plots and designs, where they mean freely. He has been long a riddle
himself, but at last finds &#338;dipuses; for his over-acted dissimulation
discovers him, and men do with him as they would with Hebrew letters,
spell him backwards and read him.</p>

winnes the game." The coincidence between Mr. Strutt's description of the
former and the passage in the text, shews that there could be little or no
difference between the value of the cards in these games, or in the manner
of playing them. "Each player has four cards dealt to him, one by one, the

at door, it is a sign sufficient, but the absence of this is supplied by
the ivy-bush: the rooms are ill breathed like the drinkers that have been
washed well over night, and are smelt-to fasting next morning; not
furnished with beds apt to be defiled, but more necessary implements,
stools, table, and a chamber-pot. It is a broacher of more news than
hogsheads, and more jests than news, which are sucked up here by some
spongy brain, and from thence squeezed into a comedy. Men come here to
make merry, but indeed make a noise, and this musick above is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> answered
with the clinking below. The drawers are the civilest people in it, men of
good bringing up, and howsoever we esteem of them, none can boast more
justly of their high calling. 'Tis the best theater of natures, where they
are truly acted, not played, and the business as in the rest of the world
up and down, to wit, from the bottom of the cellar to the great chamber. A
melancholy man would find here matter to work upon, to see heads as
brittle as glasses, and often broken; men come hither to quarrel, and come
hither to be made friends: and if Plutarch will lend me his simile, it is
even Telephus's sword that makes wounds and cures them. It is the common
consumption of the afternoon, and the murderer or maker-away of a rainy
day. It is the torrid zone that scorches <i>the</i><a name="FNanchor_25_74" id="FNanchor_25_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_74" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> face, and tobacco the
gun-powder that blows it up. Much harm would be done, if the charitable
vintner had not water ready for these flames. A house of sin you may call
it, but not a house of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> darkness, for the candles are never out; and it is
like those countries far in the North, where it is as clear at mid-night
as at mid-day. After a long sitting, it becomes like a street in a dashing
shower, where the spouts are flushing above, and the conduits running
below, while the Jordans like swelling rivers overflow their banks. To
give you the total reckoning of it; it is the busy man's recreation, the
idle man's business, the melancholy man's sanctuary, the stranger's
welcome, the inns-of-court man's entertainment, the scholar's kindness,
and the citizen's courtesy. It is the study of sparkling wits, and a cup
of canary<a name="FNanchor_26_75" id="FNanchor_26_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_75" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> their book, whence we leave them.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_75" id="Footnote_26_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_75"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> The editor of the edition in 1732, has altered <i>canary</i> to
"<i>sherry</i>" for what reason I am at a loss to discover, and have
consequently restored the reading of the first edition. Venner gives the
following description of this favourite liquor. "Canarie-wine, which
beareth the name of the islands from whence it is brought, is of some
termed a sacke, with this adjunct, sweete; but yet very improperly, for it
differeth not only from sacke in sweetness and pleasantness of taste, but
also in colour and consistence, for it is not so white in colour as sack,
nor so thin in substance; wherefore it is more nutritive than sack, and
less penetrative." <i>Via recta ad Vitam longum.</i> 4to. 1622. In Howell's
time, Canary wine was much adulterated. "I think," says he, in one of his
<i>Letters</i>, "there is more Canary brought into England than to all the
world besides; I think also, there is a hundred times more drunk under the
name of Canary wine, than there is brought in; for Sherries and Malagas,
well mingled, pass for Canaries in most taverns. When Sacks and Canaries,"
he continues, "were brought in first amongst us, they were used to be
drunk in aqua vit&aelig; measures, and 'twas held fit only for those to drink
who were used to <i>carry their legs in their hands</i>, <i>their eyes upon their
noses</i>, and an <i>almanack in their bones</i>; but now they go down every one's
throat, both young and old, like milk." Howell, <i>Letter to the lord
Cliff</i>, dated Oct. 7, 1634.</p></div>

<h3>A SHARK</h3>


<p>Is one whom all other means have failed, and he now lives of himself. He
is some needy cashiered fellow, whom the world hath oft flung off, yet
still clasps again, and is like one a drowning, fastens upon anything that
is next at hand. Amongst other of his shipwrecks he has happily lost
shame, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> this want supplies him. No man puts his brain to more use than
he, for his life is a daily invention, and each meal a new stratagem. He
has an excellent memory for his acquaintance, though there passed but <i>how
do you</i> betwixt them seven years ago, it shall suffice for an embrace, and
that for money. He offers you a pottle of sack out of joy to see you, and
in requital of his courtesy you can do no less than pay for it. He is
fumbling with his purse-strings, as a school-boy with his points, when he
is going to be whipped, 'till the master, weary with long stay, forgives
him. When the reckoning is paid, he says, It must not be so, yet is strait
pacified, and cries, What remedy? His borrowings are like subsidies, each
man a shilling or two, as he can well dispend; which they lend him, not
with a hope to be repaid, but that he will come no more. He holds a
strange tyrrany over men, for he is their debtor, and they fear him as a
creditor. He is proud of any employment, though it be but to carry
commendations, which he will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> be sure to deliver at eleven of the
clock.<a name="FNanchor_27_76" id="FNanchor_27_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_76" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> They in courtesy bid him stay, and he in manners cannot deny
them. If he find but a good look to assure his welcome, he becomes their
half-boarder, and haunts the threshold so long 'till he forces good nature
to the necessity of a quarrel. Publick invitations he will not wrong with
his absence, and is the best witness of the sheriff's hospitality.<a name="FNanchor_28_77" id="FNanchor_28_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_77" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Men
shun him at length as they would do an infection, and he is never crossed
in his way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> if there be but a lane to escape him. He has done with the age
as his clothes to him, hung on as long as he could, and at last drops off.</p>

<h3>A CARRIER</h3>


<p>Is his own hackney-man; for he lets himself out to travel as well as his
horses. He is the ordinary embassador between friend and friend, the
father and the son, and brings rich presents to the one, but never returns
any back again. He is no unlettered man, though in shew simple; for
questionless, he has much in his budget, which he can utter too in fit
time and place. He is [like] the vault<a name="FNanchor_29_78" id="FNanchor_29_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_78" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> in Gloster church,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> that
conveys whispers at a distance, for he takes the sound out of your mouth
at York, and makes it be heard as far as London. He is the young student's
joy and expectation, and the most accepted guest, to whom they lend a
willing hand to discharge him of his burden. His first greeting is
commonly, <i>Your friends are well</i>; [<i>and to prove it</i>]<a name="FNanchor_30_79" id="FNanchor_30_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_79" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> in a piece of
gold delivers their blessing. You would think him a churlish blunt fellow,
but they find in him many tokens of humanity. He is a great afflicter of
the high-ways, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> beats them out of measure; which injury is sometimes
revenged by the purse-taker, and then the voyage miscarries. No man
domineers more in his inn, nor calls his host unreverently with more
presumption, and this arrogance proceeds out of the strength of his
horses. He forgets not his load where he takes his ease, for he is drunk
commonly before he goes to bed. He is like the prodigal child, still
packing away and still returning again. But let him pass.</p>

Gloucester, was founded by Richard Stanley, abbot, in 1457, and finished
by William Farley, a monk of the monastery, in 1472. Sir Robert Atkyns
gives the following description of the vault here alluded to. "The
<i>whispering place</i> is very remarkable; it is a long alley, from one side
of the choir to the other, built circular, that it might not darken the
great east window of the choir. When a person whispers at one end of the
alley, his voice is heard distinctly at the other end, though the passage
be open in the middle, having large spaces for doors and windows on the
east side. It may be imputed to the close cement of the wall, which makes
it as one entire stone, and so conveys the voice, as a long piece of
timber does convey the least stroak to the other end. Others assign it to
the repercussion of the voice from accidental angles." <i>Atkyns' Ancient
and Present State of Glostershire. Lond. 1712, folio, page 128.</i> See also

<h3>A YOUNG MAN;</h3>


<p>He is now out of nature's protection, though not yet able to guide
himself; but left loose to the world and fortune, from which the weakness
of his childhood preserved him; and now his strength exposes him. He is,
indeed, just of age to be miserable, yet in his own conceit first begins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to be happy; and he is happier in this imagination, and his misery not
felt is less. He sees yet but the outside of the world and men, and
conceives them, according to their appearing, glister, and out of this
ignorance believes them. He pursues all vanities for happiness,
and <a name="FNanchor_31_80" id="FNanchor_31_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_80" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>[<i>enjoys them best in this fancy.</i>] His reason serves, not to curb
but understand his appetite, and prosecute the motions thereof with a more
eager earnestness. Himself is his own temptation, and needs not Satan, and
the world will come hereafter. He leaves repentance for grey hairs, and
performs it in being covetous. He is mingled with the vices of the age as
the fashion and custom, with which he longs to be acquainted, and sins to
better his understanding. He conceives his youth as the season of his
lust, and the hour wherein he ought to be bad; and because he would not
lose his time, spends it. He distastes religion as a sad thing, and is six
years elder for a thought of heaven. He scorns and fears,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> and yet hopes
for old age, but dare not imagine it with wrinkles. He loves and hates
with the same inflammation, and when the heat is over is cool alike to
friends and enemies. His friendship is seldom so stedfast, but that lust,
drink, or anger may overturn it. He offers you his blood to-day in
kindness, and is ready to take yours to-morrow. He does seldom any thing
which he wishes not to do again, and is only wise after a misfortune. He
suffers much for his knowledge, and a great deal of folly it is makes him
a wise man. He is free from many vices, by being not grown to the
performance, and is only more virtuous out of weakness. Every action is
his danger, and every man his ambush. He is a ship without pilot or
tackling, and only good fortune may steer him. If he scape this age, he
has scaped a tempest, and may live to be a man.</p>

<h3>AN OLD COLLEGE BUTLER</h3>


<p>Is none of the worst students in the house, for he keeps the set hours at
his book more duly than any. His authority is great over men's good names,
which he charges many times with shrewd aspersions, which they hardly wipe
off without payment. [His box and counters prove him to be a man of
reckoning, yet] he is stricter in his accounts than a usurer, and delivers
not a farthing without writing. He doubles the pains of <a href="#ADDITIONAL_NOTES_AND_CORRECTIONS">Gollobelgicus</a>,<a name="FNanchor_32_81" id="FNanchor_32_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_81" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
for his books go out once a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> quarter, and they are much in the same
nature, brief notes and sums of affairs, and are out of request as soon.
His comings in are like a taylor's, from the shreds of bread, [the]
chippings and remnants of a broken crust; excepting his vails from the
barrel, which poor folks buy for their hogs but drink themselves. He
divides an halfpenny loaf with more subtlety than Keckerman,<a name="FNanchor_33_82" id="FNanchor_33_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_82" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and
sub-divides the <i>&agrave; primo ortum</i> so nicely, that a stomach of great
capacity can hardly apprehend it. He is a very sober man, considering his
manifold temptations of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> drink and strangers; and if he be overseen, 'tis
within his own liberties, and no man ought to take exception. He is never
so well pleased with his place as when a gentleman is beholden to him for
shewing him the buttery, whom he greets with a cup of single beer and
sliced manchet,<a name="FNanchor_34_83" id="FNanchor_34_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_83" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and tells him it is the fashion of the college. He
domineers over freshmen when they first come to the hatch, and puzzles
them with strange language of cues and cees, and some broken Latin which
he has learnt at his bin. His faculties extraordinary is the warming of a
pair of cards, and telling out a dozen of counters for post and pair, and
no man is more methodical in these businesses. Thus he spends his age till
the tap of it is run out, and then a fresh one is set abroach.</p>

Mr. Reed, to be the "first news-paper published in England;" we are,
however, assured by the author of the "Life of Ruddiman," that it has no
title to so honourable a distinction. Gallo-Belgicus appears to have been
rather an <i>Annual Register</i>, or <i>History of its own Times</i>, than a
news-paper. It was written in Latin, and entitled. "<span class="smcap">Mercurij

uncertain, it appeared in <i>half-yearly</i> volumes. Chalmers' <i>Life of

then declined, but accepted, on a second application, in 1601. Here he
proposed to instruct his pupils in the complete science of philosophy in
the short space of three years, and, for that purpose, drew up a great
number of books upon logic, rhetoric, ethics, politics, physics,
metaphysics, geography, astronomy, &amp;c. &amp;c. till, as it is said, literally
worn out with scholastic drudgery, he died at the early age of 38.</p></div>

arms to wield it; yet being once laid o'er the shoulder with a knighthood,
he finds the herald his friend. His father was a man of good stock, though
but a tanner or usurer; he purchased the land, and his son the title. He
has doffed off the name of a <a name="FNanchor_36_85" id="FNanchor_36_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_85" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>[<i>country fellow</i>,] but the look not so
easy, and his face still bears a relish of churne-milk. He is guarded with
more gold lace than all the gentlemen of the country, yet his body makes
his clothes still out of fashion. His house-keeping is seen much in the
distinct families of dogs, and serving-men attendant on their kennels, and
the deepness of their throats is the depth of his discourse. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> hawk he

company, and stain his gentility with droppings of ale. He is fearful of
being sheriff of the shire by instinct, and dreads the assize-week as much
as the prisoner. In sum, he's but a clod of his own earth, or his land is
the dunghill and he the cock that crows over it: and commonly his race is
quickly run, and his children's children, though they escape hanging,
return to the place from whence they came.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_86" id="Footnote_37_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_86"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> The art of hawking has been so frequently and so fully
explained, that it would be superfluous, if not arrogant, to trace its
progress, or delineate its history, in this place. In the earliest periods
it appears to have been exclusively practised by the nobility; and,
indeed, the great expense at which the amusement was supported, seems to
have been a sufficient reason for deterring persons of more moderate
income, and of inferior rank, from indulging in the pursuit. In the
<i>Sports and Pastimes</i> of Mr. Strutt, a variety of instances are given of
the importance attached to the office of falconer, and of the immense
value of, and high estimation the birds themselves were held in from the
commencement of the Norman government, down to the reign of James I. in
which sir Thomas Monson gave <i>1000l.</i> for a cast of hawks, which consisted
of only <i>two</i>.
</p><p>
The great increase of wealth, and the consequent equalization of property
in this country, about the reign of Elizabeth, induced many of inferior
birth to practise the amusements of their superiors, which they did
without regard to expense, or indeed propriety. Sir Thomas Elyot, in his
<i>Governour</i> (1580), complains that the falkons of his day consumed so much
poultry, that, in a few years, he feared there would be a great scarcity
of it. "I speake not this," says he, "in disprayse of the faukons, but of
them which keepeth them lyke cockneyes." A reproof, there can be no doubt,
applicable to the character in the text.</p></div>

<h3>AN IDLE GALLANT</h3>


<p>Is one that was born and shaped for his cloaths; and, if Adam had not
fallen, had lived to no purpose. He gratulates therefore the first sin,
and fig-leaves that were an occasion of [his] bravery. His first care is
his dress, the next his body, and in the uniting of these two lies his
soul and its faculties. He observes London trulier than the terms, and his
business is the street, the stage, the court, and those places where a
proper man is best shown. If he be qualified in gaming extraordinary, he
is so much the more genteel and compleat, and he learns the best oaths for
the purpose. These are a great part of his discourse, and he is as curious
in their newness as the fashion. His other talk is ladies and such pretty
things, or some jest at a play. His pick-tooth bears a great part in his
discourse, so does his body, the upper parts whereof are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> as starched as
his linnen, and perchance use the same laundress. He has learned to ruffle
his face from his boot, and takes great delight in his walk to hear his
spurs gingle. Though his life pass somewhat slidingly, yet he seems very
careful of the time, for he is still drawing his watch out of his pocket,
and spends part of his hours in numbering them. He is one never serious
but with his taylor, when he is in conspiracy for the next device. He is
furnished with his jests, as some wanderer with sermons, some three for
all congregations, one especially against the scholar, a man to him much
ridiculous, whom he knows by no other definition, but a silly fellow in
black. He is a kind of walking mercer's shop, and shows you one stuff
to-day and another to-morrow; an ornament to the room he comes in as the
fair bed and hangings be; and it is meerly ratable accordingly, fifty or a
hundred pounds as his suit is. His main ambition is to get a knight-hood,
and then an old lady, which if he be happy in, he fills the stage and a
coach so much longer: Otherwise, himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> and his cloaths grow stale
together, and he is buried commonly ere he dies in the gaol, or the
country.</p>

<h3>A CONSTABLE</h3>


<p>Is a vice-roy in the street, and no man stands more upon't that he is the
king's officer. His jurisdiction extends to the next stocks, where he has
commission for the heels only, and sets the rest of the body at liberty.
He is a scarecrow to that ale-house, where he drinks not his morning
draught, and apprehends a drunkard for not standing in the king's name.
Beggars fear him more than the justice, and as much as the whip-stock,
whom he delivers over to his subordinate magistrates, the bridewell-man,
and the beadle. He is a great stickler in the tumults of double jugs, and
ventures his head by his place, which is broke many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> times to keep whole
the peace. He is never so much in his majesty as in his night-watch, where
he sits in his chair of state, a shop-stall, and invironed with a guard of
halberts, examines all passengers. He is a very careful man in his office,
but if he stay up after midnight you shall take him napping.</p>

<h3>A DOWN-RIGHT SCHOLAR</h3>


<p>Is one that has much learning in the ore, unwrought and untried, which
time and experience fashions and refines. He is good metal in the inside,
though rough and unscoured without, and therefore hated of the courtier,
that is quite contrary. The time has got a vein of making him ridiculous,
and men laugh at him by tradition, and no unlucky absurdity but is put
upon his profession, and done like a scholar. But his fault is only this,
that his mind is [somewhat]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> too much taken up with his mind, and his
thoughts not loaden with any carriage besides. He has not put on the
quaint garb of the age, which is now a man's [<i>Imprimis and all the
Item</i>.<a name="FNanchor_40_89" id="FNanchor_40_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_89" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>] He has not humbled his meditations to the industry of
complement, nor afflicted his brain in an elaborate leg. His body is not
set upon nice pins, to be turning and flexible for every motion, but his
scrape is homely and his nod worse. He cannot kiss his hand and cry,
madam, nor talk idle enough to bear her company. His smacking of a
gentlewoman is somewhat too savory, and he mistakes her nose for her lips.
A very woodcock would puzzle him in carving, and he wants the logick of a
capon. He has not the glib faculty of sliding over a tale, but his words
come squeamishly out of his mouth, and the laughter commonly before the
jest. He names this word college too often, and his discourse beats too
much on the university. The perplexity of mannerliness will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> let him
feed, and he is sharp set at an argument when he should cut his meat. He
is discarded for a gamester at all games but one and thirty,<a name="FNanchor_41_90" id="FNanchor_41_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_90" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and at
tables he reaches not beyond doublets. His fingers are not long and drawn
out to handle a fiddle, but his fist clunched with the habit of disputing.
He ascends a horse somewhat sinisterly, though not on the left side, and
they both go jogging in grief together. He is exceedingly censured by the
inns-of-court men, for that heinous vice being out of fashion. He cannot
speak to a dog in his own dialect, and understands Greek better than the
language of a falconer. He has been used to a dark room, and dark
cloathes, and his eyes dazzle at a sattin suit. The hermitage of his
study, has made him somewhat uncouth in the world, and men make him worse
by staring on him. Thus is he [silly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> and] ridiculous, and it continues
with him for some quarter of a year out of the university. But practise
him a little in men, and brush him over with good company, and he shall
out-ballance those glisterers, as far as a solid substance does a feather,
or gold, gold-lace.</p>

<h3>A PLAIN COUNTRY FELLOW</h3>


<p>Is one that manures his ground well, but lets himself lye fallow and
untilled. He has reason enough to do his business, and not enough to be
idle or melancholy. He seems to have the punishment of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>,
for his conversation is among beasts, and his tallons none of the
shortest, only he eats not grass, because he loves not sallets. His hand
guides the plough, and the plough his thoughts, and his ditch and
land-mark is the very mound of his meditations. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> expostulates with his
oxen very understandingly, and speaks gee, and ree, better than English.
His mind is not much distracted with objects, but if a good fat cow come
in his way, he stands dumb and astonished, and though his haste be never
so great, will fix here half an hour's contemplation. His habitation is
some poor thatched roof, distinguished from his barn by the loopholes that
let out smoak, which the rain had long since washed through, but for the
double ceiling of bacon on the inside, which has hung there from his
grandsire's time, and is yet to make rashers for posterity. His dinner is
his other work, for he sweats at it as much as at his labour; he is a
terrible fastner on a piece of beef, and you may hope to stave the guard
off sooner. His religion is a part of his copy-hold, which he takes from
his land-lord, and refers it wholly to his discretion: Yet if he give him
leave he is a good Christian to his power, (that is,) comes to church in
his best cloaths, and sits there with his neighbours, where he is capable
only of two prayers, for rain, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> fair weather. He apprehends God's
blessings only in a good year, or a fat pasture, and never praises him but
on <i>good ground</i>. Sunday he esteems a day to make merry in, and thinks a
bag-pipe as essential to it as evening-prayer, where he walks very
solemnly after service, with his hands coupled behind him, and censures
the dancing of his parish. [His compliment with his neighbour is a good
thump on the back, and his salutation commonly some blunt curse.] He
thinks nothing to be vices, but pride and ill husbandry, from which he
will gravely dissuade the youth, and has some thrifty hob-nail proverbs to
clout his discourse. He is a niggard all the week, except only market-day,
where, if his corn sell well, he thinks he may be drunk with a good
conscience. His feet never stink so unbecomingly as when he trots after a
lawyer in Westminster-hall, and even cleaves the ground with hard scraping
in beseeching his worship to take his money. He is sensible of no calamity
but the burning a stack of corn or the overflowing of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> a meadow, and
thinks Noah's flood the greatest plague that ever was, not because it
drowned the world, but spoiled the grass. For death he is never troubled,
and if he get in but his harvest before, let it come when it will, he
cares not.</p>

<h3>A PLAYER.</h3>


<p>He knows the right use of the world, wherein he comes to play a part and
so away. His life is not idle, for it is all action, and no man need be
more wary in his doings, for the eyes of all men are upon him. His
profession has in it a kind of contradiction, for none is more disliked,
and yet none more applauded; and he has the misfortune of some scholar,
too much wit makes him a fool. He is like our painting gentlewomen, seldom
in his own face, seldomer in his cloaths; and he pleases,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> the better he
counterfeits, except only when he is disguised with straw for gold lace.
He does not only personate on the stage, but sometimes in the street, for
he is masked still in the habit of a gentleman. His parts find him oaths
and good words, which he keeps for his use and discourse, and makes shew
with them of a fashionable companion. He is tragical on the stage, but
rampant in the tiring-house,<a name="FNanchor_42_91" id="FNanchor_42_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_91" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and swears oaths there which he never
conned. The waiting women spectators are over-ears in love with him, and
ladies send for him to act in their chambers. Your inns-of-court men were
undone but for him, he is their chief guest and employment, and the sole
business that makes them afternoon's-men. The poet only is his tyrant, and
he is bound to make his friend's friend drunk at his charge.
Shrove-Tuesday he fears as much as the bauds, and Lent<a name="FNanchor_43_92" id="FNanchor_43_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_92" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> is more damage
to him than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> butcher. He was never so much discredited as in one act,
and that was of parliament, which gives hostlers priviledge before him,
for which he abhors it more than a corrupt judge. But to give him his due,
one well-furnished actor has enough in him for five common gentlemen, and,
if he have a good body, [for six, and] for resolution he shall challenge
any Cato, for it has been his practice to die bravely.</p>

stage-playes, but when they goe unto places where they cannot have them,
or when, as they are suppressed by publike authority, (as in times of
pestilence, and in <i>Lent, till now of late</i>,) can well subsist without
them," &amp;c. <i>Histrio-Mastix</i>, 4to. <i>Lond. 1633. page 384.</i></p></div>

<h3>A DETRACTOR</h3>


<p>Is one of a more cunning and active envy, wherewith he gnaws not foolishly
himself, but throws it abroad and would have it blister others. He is
commonly some weak parted fellow, and worse minded, yet is strangely
ambitious to match others, not by mounting their worth, but bringing them
down with his tongue to his own poorness. He is indeed like the red dragon
that pursued the woman, for when he cannot over-reach another, he opens
his mouth and throws a flood after to drown him. You cannot anger him
worse than to do well, and he hates you more bitterly for this, than if
you had cheated him of his patrimony with your own discredit. He is always
slighting the general opinion, and wondering why such and such men should
be applauded. Commend a good divine, he cries postilling; a philologer,
pedantry; a poet, rhiming; a school-man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> dull wrangling; a sharp conceit,
boyishness; an honest man, plausibility. He comes to publick things not to
learn, but to catch, and if there be but one sol&#339;cism, that is all he
carries away. He looks on all things with a prepared sowerness, and is
still furnished with a pish beforehand, or some musty proverb that
disrelishes all things whatsoever. If fear of the company make him second
a commendation, it is like a law-writ, always with a clause of exception,
or to smooth his way to some greater scandal. He will grant you something,
and bate more; and this bating shall in conclusion take away all he
granted. His speech concludes still with an Oh! but,&mdash;and I could wish one
thing amended; and this one thing shall be enough to deface all his former
commendations. He will be very inward with a man to fish some bad out of
him, and make his slanders hereafter more authentick, when it is said a
friend reported it. He will inveigle you to naughtiness to get your good
name into his clutches; he will be your pandar to have you on the hip for
a whore-master, and make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> you drunk to shew you reeling. He passes the
more plausibly because all men have a smatch of his humour, and it is
thought freeness which is malice. If he can say nothing of a man, he will
seem to speak riddles, as if he could tell strange stories if he would;
and when he has racked his invention to the utmost, he ends;&mdash;but I wish
him well, and therefore must hold my peace. He is always listening and
enquiring after men, and suffers not a cloak to pass by him unexamined. In
brief, he is one that has lost all good himself, and is loth to find it in
another.</p>

<h3>A YOUNG GENTLEMAN OF THE UNIVERSITY</h3>


<p>Is one that comes there to wear a gown, and to say hereafter, he has been
at the university. His father sent him thither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> because he heard there
were the best fencing and dancing-schools; from these he has his
education, from his tutor the over-sight. The first element of his
knowledge is to be shewn the colleges, and initiated in a tavern by the
way, which hereafter he will learn of himself. The two marks of his
seniority, is the bare velvet of his gown, and his proficiency at tennis,
where when he can once play a set, he is a fresh man no more. His study
has commonly handsome shelves, his books neat silk strings, which he shews
to his father's man, and is loth to unty<a name="FNanchor_44_93" id="FNanchor_44_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_93" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> or take down for fear of
misplacing. Upon foul days for recreation he retires thither, and looks
over the pretty book his tutor reads to him, which is commonly some short<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
history, or a piece of Euphormio; for which his tutor gives him money to
spend next day. His main loytering is at the library, where he studies
arms and books of honour, and turns a gentleman critick in pedigrees. Of
all things he endures not to be mistaken for a scholar, and hates a black
suit though it be made of sattin. His companion is ordinarily some stale
fellow, that has been notorious for an ingle to gold hatbands,<a name="FNanchor_45_94" id="FNanchor_45_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_94" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> whom he
admires at first, afterward scorns. If he have spirit or wit he may light
of better company, and may learn some flashes of wit, which may do him
knight's service in the country hereafter. But he is now gone to the
inns-of-court, where he studies to forget what he learned before, his
acquaintance and the fashion.</p>

<h3>A WEAK MAN</h3>


<p>Is a child at man's estate, one whom nature huddled up in haste, and left
his best part unfinished. The rest of him is grown to be a man, only his
brain stays behind. He is one that has not improved his first rudiments,
nor attained any proficiency by his stay in the world: but we may speak of
him yet as when he was in the bud, a good harmless nature, a well meaning
mind<a name="FNanchor_46_95" id="FNanchor_46_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_95" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> [<i>and no more</i>.] It is his misery that he now wants a tutor, and
is too old to have one. He is two steps above a fool, and a great many
more below a wise man; yet the fool is oft given him, and by those whom he
esteems most. Some tokens of him are,&mdash;he loves men better upon relation
than experience, for he is exceedingly enamoured of strangers, and none
quicklier a weary of his friend. He charges you at first meeting with all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
his secrets, and on better acquaintance grows more reserved. Indeed he is
one that mistakes much his abusers for friends, and his friends for
enemies, and he apprehends your hate in nothing so much as in good
council. One that is flexible with any thing but reason, and then only
perverse. [A servant to every tale and flatterer, and whom the last man
still works over.] A great affecter of wits and such prettinesses; and his
company is costly to him, for he seldom has it but invited. His friendship
commonly is begun in a supper, and lost in lending money. The tavern is a
dangerous place to him, for to drink and be drunk is with him all one, and
his brain is sooner quenched than his thirst. He is drawn into naughtiness
with company, but suffers alone, and the bastard commonly laid to his
charge. One that will be patiently abused, and take exception a month
after when he understands it, and then be abused again into a
reconcilement; and you cannot endear him more than by cozening him, and it
is a temptation to those that would not. One discoverable in all silliness
to all men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> but himself, and you may take any man's knowledge of him
better than his own. He will promise the same thing to twenty, and rather
than deny one break with all. One that has no power over himself, over his
business, over his friends, but a prey and pity to all; and if his
fortunes once sink, men quickly cry, Alas!&mdash;and forget him.</p>

<h3>A TOBACCO-SELLER</h3>


<p>Is the only man that finds good in it which others brag of but do not; for
it is meat, drink, and clothes to him. No man opens his ware with greater
seriousness, or challenges your judgment more in the approbation. His shop
is the rendezvous of spitting, where men dialogue with their noses, and
their communication is smoak.<a name="FNanchor_47_96" id="FNanchor_47_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_96" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> It is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> place only where Spain is
commended and preferred before England itself. He should be well
experienced in the world, for he has daily trial of men's nostrils, and
none is better acquainted with humours. He is the piecing commonly of some
other trade, which is bawd to his tobacco, and that to his wife, which is
the flame that follows this smoak.</p>

<h3>A POT-POET</h3>


<p>Is the dregs of wit, yet mingled with good drink may have some relish. His
inspirations are more real than others, for they do but feign a God, but
he has his by him. His verse runs like the tap, and his invention as the
barrel, ebbs and flows at the mercy of the spiggot. In thin drink he
aspires not above a ballad, but a cup of sack inflames him, and sets his
muse and nose a-fire together. The press is his mint, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> stamps him now
and then a six-pence or two in reward of the baser coin his pamphlet. His
works would scarce sell for three half-pence, though they are given oft
for three shillings, but for the pretty title that allures the country
gentleman; for which the printer maintains him in ale a fortnight. His
verses are like his clothes miserable centoes<a name="FNanchor_48_97" id="FNanchor_48_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_97" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and patches, yet their
pace is not altogether so hobbling as an almanack's. The death of a great
man or the <i>burning</i><a name="FNanchor_49_98" id="FNanchor_49_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_98" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> of a house furnish him with an argument, and the
nine muses are out strait in mourning gowns, and Melpomene cries fire!
fire! [His other poems are but briefs in rhime, and like the poor Greeks
collections to redeem from captivity.] He is a man now much employed in
commendations of our navy, and a bitter inveigher against the Spaniard.
His frequentest works go out in single sheets,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> and are chanted from
market to market to a vile tune and a worse throat; whilst the poor
country wench melts like her butter to hear them. And these are the
stories of some men of Tyburn, or a strange monster out of Germany;<a name="FNanchor_50_99" id="FNanchor_50_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_99" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
or, sitting in a bawdy-house, he writes God's judgments. He drops away at
last in some obscure painted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> cloth, to which himself made the verses,<a name="FNanchor_51_100" id="FNanchor_51_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_100" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
and his life, like a cann too full, spills upon the bench. He leaves
twenty shillings on the score, which my hostess loses.</p>

<p>Is one that would fain run an even path in the world, and jut against no
man. His endeavour is not to offend, and his aim the general opinion. His
conversation is a kind of continued compliment, and his life a practice of
manners. The relation he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> bears to others, a kind of fashionable respect,
not friendship but friendliness, which is equal to all and general, and
his kindnesses seldom exceed courtesies. He loves not deeper mutualities,
because he would not take sides, nor hazard himself on displeasures, which
he principally avoids. At your first acquaintance with him he is exceeding
kind and friendly, and at your twentieth meeting after but friendly still.
He has an excellent command over his patience and tongue, especially the
last, which he accommodates always to the times and persons, and speaks
seldom what is sincere, but what is civil. He is one that uses all
companies, drinks all healths, and is reasonable cool in all religions.
[He considers who are friends to the company, and speaks well where he is
sure to hear of it again.] He can listen to a foolish discourse with an
applausive attention, and conceal his laughter at nonsense. Silly men much
honour and esteem him, because by his fair reasoning with them as with men
of understanding, he puts them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> into an erroneous opinion of themselves,
and makes them forwarder hereafter to their own discovery. He is one
<i>rather well</i><a name="FNanchor_52_101" id="FNanchor_52_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_101" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> thought on than beloved, and that love he has is more of
whole companies together than any one in particular. Men gratify him
notwithstanding with a good report, and whatever vices he has besides, yet
having no enemies, he is sure to be an honest fellow.</p>

<h3>A BOWL-ALLEY</h3>


<p>Is the place where there are three things thrown away beside bowls, to
wit, time, money, and curses, and the last ten for one. The best sport in
it is the gamesters, and he enjoys it that looks on and bets not. It is
the school of wrangling, and worse than the schools, for men will cavil
here for a hair's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> breadth, and make a stir where a straw would end the
controversy. No antick screws men's bodies into such strange flexures, and
you would think them here senseless, to speak sense to their bowl, and put
their trust in intreaties for a good cast. The betters are the factious
noise of the alley, or the gamesters beadsmen that pray for them. They are
somewhat like those that are cheated by great men, for they lose their
money and must say nothing. It is the best discovery of humours,
especially in the losers, where you have fine variety of impatience,
whilst some fret, some rail, some swear, and others more ridiculously
comfort themselves with philosophy. To give you the moral of it; it is the
emblem of the world, or the world's ambition: where most are short, or
over, or wide or wrong-biassed, and some few justle in to the mistress
fortune. And it is here as in the court, where the nearest are most
spited, and all blows aimed at the toucher.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE WORLD'S WISE MAN</h3>


<p>Is an able and sufficient wicked man: It is a proof of his sufficiency
that he is not called wicked, but wise. A man wholly determined in himself
and his own ends, and his instruments herein any thing that will do it.
His friends are a part of his engines, and as they serve to his works,
used or laid by: Indeed he knows not this thing of friend, but if he give
you the name, it is a sign he has a plot on you. Never more active in his
businesses, than when they are mixed with some harm to others; and it is
his best play in this game to strike off and lie in the place: Successful
commonly in these undertakings, because he passes smoothly those rubs
which others stumble at, as conscience and the like; and gratulates
himself much in this advantage. Oaths and falshood he counts the nearest
way, and loves not by any means to go about. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> has many fine quips at
this folly of plain dealing, but his "tush!" is greatest at religion; yet
he uses this too, and virtue and good words, but is less dangerously a
devil than a saint. He ascribes all honesty to an unpractisedness in the
world, and conscience a thing merely for children. He scorns all that are
so silly to <i>trust</i><a name="FNanchor_53_102" id="FNanchor_53_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_102" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> him, and only not scorns his enemy, especially if
as bad as himself: he fears him as a man well armed and provided, but sets
boldly on good natures, as the most vanquishable. One that seriously
admires those worst princes, as Sforza, Borgia, and Richard the third; and
calls matters of deep villany things of difficulty. To whom murders are
but resolute acts, and treason a business of great consequence. One whom
two or three countries make up to this compleatness, and he has travelled
for the purpose. His deepest indearment is a communication of mischief,
and then only you have him fast. His conclusion is commonly one of these
two, either a great man, or hanged.</p>

<h3>A SURGEON</h3>


<p>Is one that has some business about this building or little house of man,
whereof nature is as it were the tiler, and he the plaisterer. It is ofter
out of reparations than an old parsonage, and then he is set on work to
patch it again. He deals most with broken commodities, as a broken head or
a mangled face, and his gains are very ill got, for he lives by the hurts
of the commonwealth. He differs from a physician as a sore does from a
disease, or the sick from those that are not whole, the one distempers you
within, the other blisters you without. He complains of the decay of
valour in these days, and sighs for that slashing age of sword and
buckler; and thinks the law against duels was made meerly to wound his
vocation. He had been long since undone if the charity of the stews had
not relieved him, from whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> he has his tribute as duly as the pope; or a
wind-fall sometimes from a tavern, if a quart pot hit right. The rareness
of his custom makes him pitiless when it comes, and he holds a patient
longer than our [spiritual] courts a cause. He tells you what danger you
had been in if he had staid but a minute longer, and though it be but a
pricked finger, he makes of it much matter. He is a reasonable cleanly
man, considering the scabs he has to deal with, and your finest ladies are
now and then beholden to him for their best dressings. He curses old
gentlewomen and their charity that makes his trade their alms; but his
envy is never stirred so much as when gentlemen go over to fight upon
Calais sands,<a name="FNanchor_54_103" id="FNanchor_54_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_103" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> whom he wishes drowned e'er they come there, rather than

<h3>A CONTEMPLATIVE MAN</h3>


<p>Is a scholar in this great university the world; and the same his book and
study. He cloysters not his meditations in the narrow darkness of a room,
but sends them abroad with his eyes, and his brain travels with his feet.
He looks upon man from a high tower, and sees him trulier at this distance
in his infirmities and poorness. He scorns to mix himself in men's
actions, as he would to act upon a stage; but sits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> aloft on the scaffold
a censuring spectator. [He will not lose his time by being busy, or make
so poor a use of the world as to hug and embrace it.] Nature admits him as
a partaker of her sports, and asks his approbation as it were of her own
works and variety. He comes not in company, because he would not be
solitary, but finds discourse enough with himself, and his own thoughts
are his excellent playfellows. He looks not upon a thing as a yawning
stranger at novelties, but his search is more mysterious and inward, and
he spells heaven out of earth. He knits his observations together, and
makes a ladder of them all to climb to God. He is free from vice, because
he has no occasion to imploy it, and is above those ends that make man
wicked. He has learnt all can here be taught him, and comes now to heaven
to see more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<h3>A SHE PRECISE HYPOCRITE</h3>


<p>Is one in whom good women suffer, and have their truth misinterpreted by
her folly. She is one, she knows not what her self if you ask her, but she
is indeed one that has taken a toy at the fashion of religion, and is
enamoured of the new fangle. She is a nonconformist in a close stomacher
and ruff of Geneva print,<a name="FNanchor_55_104" id="FNanchor_55_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_104" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and her purity consists much in her linnen.
She has heard of the rag of Rome, and thinks it a very sluttish religion,
and rails at the whore of Babylon for a very naughty woman. She has left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
her virginity as a relick of popery, and marries in her tribe without a
ring. Her devotion at the church is much in the turning up of her eye; and
turning down the leaf in her book, when she hears named chapter and verse.
When she comes home, she commends the sermon for the scripture, and two
hours. She loves preaching better then praying, and of preachers,
lecturers; and thinks the week day's exercise far more edifying than the
Sunday's. Her oftest gossipings are sabbath-day's journeys, where, (though
an enemy to superstition,) she will go in pilgrimage five mile to a
silenced minister, when there is a better sermon in her own parish. She
doubts of the virgin Mary's salvation, and dares not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> saint her, but knows
her own place in heaven as perfectly as the pew she has a key to. She is
so taken up with faith she has no room for charity, and understands no
good works but what are wrought on the sampler. She accounts nothing vices
but superstition and an oath, and thinks adultery a less sin than to swear
<i>by my truly</i>. She rails at other women by the names of Jezebel and
Dalilah; and calls her own daughters Rebecca and Abigail, and not Ann but
Hannah. She suffers them not to learn on the virginals,<a name="FNanchor_56_105" id="FNanchor_56_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_105" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> because of
their affinity with organs, but is reconciled to the bells for the chimes
sake, since they were reformed to the tune of a psalm. She overflows so
with the bible, that she spills it upon every occasion, and will not
cudgel her maids without scripture. It is a question whether she is more
troubled with the Devil, or the Devil with her: She is always challenging
and daring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> him, and her weapon [<a name="FNanchor_57_106" id="FNanchor_57_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_106" class="fnanchor">[57]</a><i>is the Practice of Piety</i>.] Nothing
angers her so much as that women cannot preach, and in this point only
thinks the Brownist erroneous; but what she cannot at the church she does
at the table, where she prattles more than any against sense and
Antichrist, 'till a capon's wing silence her. She expounds the priests of
Baal, reading ministers, and thinks the salvation of that parish as
desperate as the Turks. She is a main derider to her capacity of those
that are not her preachers, and censures all sermons but bad ones. If her
husband be a tradesman, she helps him to customers, howsoever to good
cheer, and they are a most faithful couple at these meetings, for they
never fail. Her conscience is like others lust, never satisfied, and you
might better answer Scotus than her scruples. She is one that thinks she
performs all her duties to God in hearing, and shews the fruits of it in
talking. She is more fiery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> against the may-pole than her husband, and
thinks she might do a Phineas' act to break the pate of the fidler. She is
an everlasting argument, but I am weary of her.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_104" id="Footnote_55_104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_104"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> Strict devotees were, I believe, noted for the smallness and
precision of their <i>ruffs</i>, which were termed <i>in print</i> from the
exactness of the folds. So in Mynshul's <i>Essays</i>, 4to. 1618. "I vndertooke
a warre when I adventured to speake in <i>print</i>, (not in <i>print as
Puritan's ruffes</i> are set.)" The term of <i>Geneva print</i> probably arose
from the minuteness of the type used at Geneva. In the <i>Merry Devil of
Edmonton</i>, a comedy, 4to. 1608, is an expression which goes some way to
prove the correctness of this supposition:&mdash;"I see by thy eyes thou hast
bin reading <i>little Geneua print</i>;"&mdash;and, that <i>small ruffs</i> were worn by
the puritanical set, an instance appears in Mayne's <i>City Match</i>, a
comedy, 4to. 1658.

From these three extracts it is, I think, clear that a <i>ruff of Geneva

<h3>A SCEPTICK IN RELIGION</h3>


<p>Is one that hangs in the balance with all sorts of opinions, whereof not
one but stirs him and none sways him. A man guiltier of credulity than he
is taken to be; for it is out of his belief of every thing, that he fully
believes nothing. Each religion scares him from its contrary: none
persuades him to itself. He would be wholly a Christian, but that he is
something of an atheist, and wholly an atheist, but that he is partly a
Christian; and a perfect heretic, but that there are so many to distract
him. He finds reason in all opinions, truth in none: indeed the least
reason perplexes him, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> the best will not satisfy him. He is at most a
confused and wild Christian, not specialized by any form, but capable of
all. He uses the land's religion, because it is next him, yet he sees not
why he may not take the other, but he chuses this, not as better, but
because there is not a pin to choose. He finds doubts and scruples better
than resolves them, and is always too hard for himself. His learning is
too much for his brain, and his judgment too little for his learning, and
his over-opinion of both, spoils all. Pity it was his mischance of being a
scholar; for it does only distract and irregulate him, and the world by
him. He hammers much in general upon our opinion's uncertainty, and the
possibility of erring makes him not venture on what is true. He is
troubled at this naturalness of religion to countries, that protestantism
should be born so in England and popery abroad, and that fortune and the
stars should so much share in it. He likes not this connection of the
common-weal and divinity, and fears it may be an arch-practice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> of state.
In our differences with Rome he is strangely unfixed, and a new man every
new day, as his last discourse-book's meditations transport him. He could
like the gray hairs of popery, did not some dotages there stagger him: he
would come to us sooner, but our new name affrights him. He is taken with
their miracles, but doubts an imposture; he conceives of our doctrine
better, but it seems too empty and naked. He cannot drive into his fancy
the circumscription of truth to our corner, and is as hardly persuaded to
think their old legends true. He approves well of our faith, and more of
their works, and is sometimes much affected at the zeal of Amsterdam. His
conscience interposes itself betwixt duellers, and whilst it would part
both, is by both wounded. He will sometimes propend much to us upon the
reading a good writer, and at Bellarmine<a name="FNanchor_58_107" id="FNanchor_58_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_107" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> recoils as far back again;
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> the fathers justle him from one side to another. Now Socinus<a name="FNanchor_59_108" id="FNanchor_59_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_108" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and
Vorstius<a name="FNanchor_60_109" id="FNanchor_60_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_109" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> afresh torture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> him, and he agrees with none worse than
himself. He puts his foot into heresies tenderly, as a cat in the water,
and pulls it out again, and still something unanswered delays him; yet he
bears away some parcel of each, and you may sooner pick all religions out
of him than one. He cannot think so many wise men should be in error, nor
so many honest men out of the way, and his wonder is double when he sees
these oppose one another. He hates authority as the tyrant of reason, and
you cannot anger him worse than with a father's <i>dixit</i>, and yet that many
are not persuaded with reason, shall authorise his doubt. In sum,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> his
whole life is a question, and his salvation a greater, which death only
concludes, and then he is resolved.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_58_107" id="Footnote_58_107"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_107"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> Robert Bellarmin, an Italian Jesuit, was born at Monte
Pulciano, a town in Tuscany, in the year 1542, and in 1560 entered himself
among the Jesuits. In 1599 he was honoured with a cardinal's hat, and in
1602 was presented with the arch-bishopric of Capua: this, however, he
resigned in 1605, when pope Paul V. desired to have him near himself. He
was employed in the affairs of the court of Rome till 1621, when, leaving
the Vatican, he retired to a house belonging to his order, and died
September 17, in the same year.
</p><p>
Bellarmin was one of the best controversial writers of his time; few
authors have done greater honour to their profession or opinions, and
certain it is that none have ever more ably defended the cause of the
Romish church, or contended in favour of the pope with greater advantage.
As a proof of Bellarmin's abilities, there was scarcely a divine of any
eminence among the protestants who did not attack him: Bayle aptly says,
"they made his name resound every where, ut littus <a href="#ADDITIONAL_NOTES_AND_CORRECTIONS">Styla</a>, Styla, omne
sonaret."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59_108" id="Footnote_59_108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_108"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> Faustus Socinus is so well known as the founder of the sect
which goes under his name, that a few words will be sufficient. He was
born in 1539, at Sienna, and imbibed his opinions from the instruction of
his uncle, who always had a high opinion of, and confidence in, the
abilities of his nephew, to whom he bequeathed all his papers. After
living several years in the world, principally at the court of Francis de
Medicis, Socinus, in 1577, went into Germany, and began to propagate the
principles of his uncle, to which, it is said, he made great additions and
alterations of his own. In the support of his opinions, he suffered
considerable hardships, and received the greatest insults and
persecutions; to avoid which, he retired to a place near Cracow, in
Poland, where he died in 1504, at the age of sixty-five.</p></div>

detested by the Calvinists, and who had even the honour to be attacked by
king James the first, of England, was born in 1569. Being compelled,
through the interposition of James's ambassador, to quit <a href="#ADDITIONAL_NOTES_AND_CORRECTIONS">Leiden</a>, where he
had attained the divinity-chair, and several other preferments, he retired
to Toningen, where he died in 1622, with the strongest tokens of piety and
resignation.</p></div>

<p>His antient beginning was a blue coat, since a livery, and his hatching
under a lawyer; whence, though but pen-feathered, he hath now nested for
himself, and with his boarded pence purchased an office. Two desks and a
quire of paper set him up, where he now sits in state for all corners. We
can call him no great author, yet he writes very much and with the infamy
of the court is maintained in his libels.<a name="FNanchor_61_110" id="FNanchor_61_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_110" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> He has some smatch of a

cuts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> it off in the midst, and will not let it speak out. He is, contrary
to great men, maintained by his followers, that is, his poor country
clients, that worship him more than their landlords, and be they never
such churls, he looks for their courtesy. He first racks them soundly
himself, and then delivers them to the lawyer for execution. His looks are
very solicitous, importing much haste and dispatch, he is never without
his hands full of business, that is&mdash;of paper. His skin becomes at last as
dry as his parchment, and his face as intricate as the most winding cause.
He talks statutes as fiercely as if he had mooted<a name="FNanchor_62_111" id="FNanchor_62_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_111" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> seven years in the
inns of court, when all his skill is stuck in his girdle, or in his
office-window. Strife and wrangling have made him rich, and he is thankful
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> his benefactor, and nourishes it. If he live in a country village, he
makes all his neighbours good subjects; for there shall be nothing done
but what there is law for. His business gives him not leave to think of
his conscience, and when the time, or term of his life is going out, for
dooms-day he is secure; for he hopes he has a trick to reverse judgment.</p>

weighing men in the scale of comparisons, and puts his affections in the

rarely hear good of his enemy. He considers first the man and then the
thing, and restrains all merit to what they deserve of him. Commendations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
he esteems not the debt of worth, but the requital of kindness; and if you
ask his reason, shews his interest, and tells you how much he is beholden
to that man. He is one that ties his judgment to the wheel of fortune, and
they determine giddily both alike. He prefers England before other
countries because he was born there, and Oxford before other universities,
because he was brought up there, and the best scholar there is one of his
own college, and the best scholar there is one of his friends. He is a
great favourer of great persons, and his argument is still that which
should be antecedent; as,&mdash;he is in high place, therefore virtuous;&mdash;he is
preferred, therefore worthy. Never ask his opinion, for you shall hear but
his faction, and he is indifferent in nothing but conscience. Men esteem
him for this a zealous affectionate, but they mistake him many times, for
he does it but to be esteemed so. Of all men he is worst to write an
history, for he will praise a Sejanus or Tiberius, and for some petty
respect of his all posterity shall be cozened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<h3>A TRUMPETER</h3>


<p>Is the elephant with the great trunk, for he eats nothing but what comes
through this way. His profession is not so worthy as to occasion
insolence, and yet no man so much puft up. His face is as brazen as his
trumpet, and (which is worse,) as a fidler's, from whom he differeth only
in this, that his impudence is dearer. The sea of drink and much wind make
a storm perpetually in his cheeks, and his look is like his noise,
blustering and tempestuous. He was whilom the sound of war, but now of
peace; yet as terrible as ever, for wheresoever he comes they are sure to
pay for it. He is the common attendant of glittering folks, whether in the
court or stage, where he is always the prologue's prologue.<a name="FNanchor_63_112" id="FNanchor_63_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_112" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> He is
somewhat in the nature of a hogshead,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> shrillest when he is empty; when
his belly is full he is quiet enough. No man proves life more to be a
blast, or himself a bubble, and he is like a counterfeit bankrupt, thrives
best when he is blown up.</p>

<h3>A VULGAR-SPIRITED MAN</h3>


<p>Is one of the herd of the world. One that follows merely the common cry,
and makes it louder by one. A man that loves none but who are publickly
affected, and he will not be wiser than the rest of the town. That never
owns a friend after an ill name, or some general imputation, though he
knows it most unworthy. That opposes to reason,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> "thus men say;" and "thus
most do;" and "thus the world goes;" and thinks this enough to poise the
other. That worships men in place, and those only; and thinks all a great
man speaks oracles. Much taken with my lord's jest, and repeats you it all
to a syllable. One that justifies nothing out of fashion, nor any opinion
out of the applauded way. That thinks certainly all Spaniards and Jesuits
very villains, and is still cursing the pope and Spinola. One that thinks
the gravest cassock the best scholar; and the best cloaths the finest man.
That is taken only with broad and obscene wit, and hisses any thing too
deep for him. That cries, Chaucer for his money above all our English
poets, because the voice has gone so, and he has read none. That is much
ravished with such a nobleman's courtesy, and would venture his life for
him, because he put off his hat. One that is foremost still to kiss the
king's hand, and cries, "God bless his majesty!" loudest. That rails on
all men condemned and out of favour, and the first that says "away with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the traitors!"&mdash;yet struck with much ruth at executions, and for pity to
see a man die, could kill the hangman. That comes to London to see it, and
the pretty things in it, and, the chief cause of his journey, the bears.
That measures the happiness of the kingdom by the cheapness of corn, and
conceives no harm of state, but ill trading. Within this compass too, come
those that are too much wedged into the world, and have no lifting
thoughts above those things; that call to thrive, to do well; and
preferment only the grace of God. That aim all studies at this mark, and
shew you poor scholars as an example to take heed by. That think the
prison and want a judgment for some sin, and never like well hereafter of
a jail-bird. That know no other content but wealth, bravery, and the
town-pleasures; that think all else but idle speculation, and the
philosophers madmen. In short, men that are carried away with all
outwardnesses, shews, appearances, the stream, the people; for there is no
man of worth but has a piece of singularity, and scorns something.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<h3>A PLODDING STUDENT</h3>


<p>Is a kind of alchymist or persecutor of nature, that would change the dull
lead of his brain into finer metal, with success many times as
unprosperous, or at least not quitting the cost, to wit, of his own oil
and candles. He has a strange forced appetite to learning, and to atchieve
it brings nothing but patience and a body. His study is not great but
continual, and consists much in the sitting up till after midnight in a
rug-gown and a night-cap, to the vanquishing perhaps of some six lines;
yet what he has, he has perfect, for he reads it so long to understand it,
till he gets it without book. He may with much industry make a breach into
logick, and arrive at some ability in an argument; but for politer studies
he dare not skirmish with them, and for poetry accounts it impregnable.
His invention is no more than the finding out of his papers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> and his few
gleanings there; and his disposition of them is as just as the
bookbinders, a setting or glewing of them together. He is a great
discomforter of young students, by telling them what travel it has cost
him, and how often his brain turned at philosophy, and makes others fear
studying as a cause of duncery. He is a man much given to apothegms, which
serve him for wit, and seldom breaks any jest but which belongs to some
Lacedemonian or Roman in Lycosthenes. He is like a dull carrier's horse,
that will go a whole week together, but never out of a foot pace; and he
that sets forth on the Saturday shall overtake him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Is the land's epitome, or you may call it the lesser isle of Great
Britain. It is more than this, the whole world's map, which you may here
discern in its perfectest motion, justling and turning. It is a heap of
stones and men, with a vast confusion of languages;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> and were the steeple
not sanctified, nothing liker Babel. The noise in it is like that of bees,
a strange humming or buzz mixed of walking tongues and feet: it is a kind
of still roar or loud whisper. It is the great exchange of all discourse,
and no business whatsoever but is here stirring and a-foot. It is the
synod of all pates politick, jointed and laid together in most serious
posture, and they are not half so busy at the parliament. It is the antick
of tails to tails, and backs to backs, and for vizards you need go no
farther than faces. It is the market of young lecturers, whom you may
cheapen here at all rates and sizes. It is the general mint of all famous
lies, which are here like the legends of popery, first coined and stamped
in the church. All inventions are emptied here, and not few pockets. The
best sign of a temple in it is, that it is the thieves sanctuary, which
rob more safely in the crowd than a wilderness, whilst every searcher is a
bush to hide them. It is the other expence of the day, after plays,
tavern, and a bawdy-house; and men have still some oaths left to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> swear
here. It is the ear's brothel, and satisfies their lust and itch. The
visitants are all men without exceptions, but the principal inhabitants
and possessors are stale knights and captains<a name="FNanchor_65_114" id="FNanchor_65_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_114" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> out of service; men of
long rapiers and breeches, which after all turn merchants here and
traffick for news. Some make it a preface to their dinner, and travel for
a stomach; but thriftier men make it their ordinary, and board here very
cheap.<a name="FNanchor_66_115" id="FNanchor_66_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_115" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Of all such places it is least haunted with hobgoblins, for if

<h3>A COOK.</h3>


<p>The kitchen is his hell, and he the devil in it, where his meat and he fry
together. His revenues are showered down from the fat of the land, and he
interlards his own grease among to help the drippings. Cholerick he is not
by nature so much as his art, and it is a shrewd temptation that the
chopping-knife is so near. His weapons, ofter offensive, are a mess of hot
broth and scalding water, and woe be to him that comes in his way. In the
kitchen he will domineer and rule the roast in spight of his master, and
curses in the very dialect of his calling. His labour is meer blustering
and fury, and his speech like that of sailors in a storm, a thousand
businesses at once; yet, in all this tumult, he does not love combustion,
but will be the first man that shall go and quench it. He is never a good
christian till a hissing pot of ale has slacked him, like water cast on a
firebrand, and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> that time he is tame and dispossessed. His cunning is
not small in architecture, for he builds strange fabricks in paste, towers
and castles, which are offered to the assault of valiant teeth, and like
Darius' palace in one banquet demolished. He is a pittiless murderer of
innocents, and he mangles poor fowls with unheard-of tortures; and it is
thought the martyrs persecutions were devised from hence: sure we are, St.
Lawrence's gridiron came out of his kitchen. His best faculty is at the
dresser, where he seems to have great skill in the tacticks, ranging his
dishes in order military, and placing with great discretion in the
fore-front meats more strong and hardy, and the more cold and cowardly in
the rear; as quaking tarts and quivering custards, and such milk-sop
dishes, which scape many times the fury of the encounter. But now the
second course is gone up and he down in the cellar, where he drinks and
sleeps till four o'clock<a name="FNanchor_67_116" id="FNanchor_67_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_116" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> in the afternoon, and then returns again to

<h3>A BOLD FORWARD MAN</h3>


<p>Is a lusty fellow in a crowd, that is beholden more to his elbow than his
legs, for he does not go, but thrusts well. He is a good shuffler in the
world, wherein he is so oft putting forth, that at length he puts on. He
can do some things, but dare do much more, and is like a desperate
soldier, who will assault any thing where he is sure not to enter. He is
not so well opinioned of himself, as industrious to make others, and
thinks no vice so prejudicial as blushing. He is still citing for himself,
that a candle should not be hid under a bushel; and for his part he will
be sure not to hide his, though his candle be but a snuff or rush-candle.
Those few good parts he has, he is no niggard in displaying, and is like
some needy flaunting goldsmith, nothing in the inner room, but all on the
cupboard. If he be a scholar, he has commonly stepped into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> the pulpit
before a degree, yet into that too before he deserved it. He never defers
St. Mary's beyond his regency, and his next sermon is at Paul's cross,<a name="FNanchor_68_117" id="FNanchor_68_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_117" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
[and that printed.] He loves publick things alive; and for any solemn
entertainment he will find a mouth, find a speech who will. He is greedy
of great acquaintance and many, and thinks it no small advancement to rise
to be known. [He is one that has all the great names at court at his
fingers ends, and their lodgings; and with a saucy, "my lord," will salute
the best of them.] His talk at the table is like Benjamin's mess, five
times to his part, and no argument shuts him out for a quarreller. Of all
disgraces he endures not to be non-plussed, and had rather fly for
sanctuary to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> nonsense which few descry, than to nothing which all. His
boldness is beholden to other men's modesty, which rescues him many times
from a baffle; yet his face is good armour, and he is dashed out of any
thing sooner than countenance. Grosser conceits are puzzled in him for a
rare man; and wiser men though they know him [yet] take him [in] for their
pleasure, or as they would do a sculler for being next at hand. Thus
preferment at last stumbles on him, because he is still in the way. His
companions that flouted him before, now envy him, when they see him come
ready for scarlet, whilst themselves lye musty in their old clothes and
colleges.</p>

dinner. He abhors, therefore, works of charity, and thinks his bread cast
away when it is given to the poor. He loves not justice neither, for the
weigh-scale's sake, and hates the clerk of the market as his executioner;
yet he finds mercy in his offences, and his basket only is sent to

<h3>A PRETENDER TO LEARNING</h3>


<p>Is one that would make all others more fools than himself, for though he
know nothing, he would not have the would know so much. He conceits
nothing in learning but the opinion, which he seeks to purchase without
it, though he might with less labour cure his ignorance than hide it. He
is indeed a kind of scholar-mountebank, and his art our delusion. He is
tricked out in all the accoutrements of learning, and at the first
encounter none passes better. He is oftener in his study than at his book,
and you cannot pleasure him better than to deprehend him: yet he hears you
not till the third knock, and then comes out very angry as interrupted.
You find him in his <i>slippers</i><a name="FNanchor_71_120" id="FNanchor_71_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_120" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and a pen in his ear, in which
formality he was asleep. His table is spread<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> wide with some classick
folio, which is as constant to it as the carpet, and hath laid open in the
same page this half year. His candle is always a longer sitter up than
himself, and the <i>boast</i><a name="FNanchor_72_121" id="FNanchor_72_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_121" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> of his window at midnight. He walks much
alone in the posture of meditation, and has a book still before his face
in the fields. His pocket is seldom without a Greek testament or Hebrew
bible, which he opens only in the church, and that when some stander-by
looks over. He has sentences for company, some scatterings of Seneca and
Tacitus, which are good upon all occasions. If he reads any thing in the
morning, it comes up all at dinner; and as long as that lasts, the
discourse is his. He is a great plagiary of tavern wit, and comes to
sermons only that he may talk of Austin. His parcels are the meer
scrapings from company, yet he complains at parting what time he has lost.
He is wondrously capricious to seem a judgment, and listens with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> a sower
attention to what he understands not. He talks much of Scaliger, and
Casaubon, and the Jesuits, and prefers some unheard-of Dutch name before
them all. He has verses to bring in upon these and these hints, and it
shall go hard but he will wind in his opportunity. He is critical in a
language he cannot conster, and speaks seldom under Arminius in divinity.
His business and retirement and caller away is his study, and he protests
no delight to it comparable. He is a great nomenclator of authors, which
he has read in general in the catalogue, and in particular in the title,
and goes seldom so far as the dedication. He never talks of any thing but
learning, and learns all from talking. Three encounters with the same men
pump him, and then he only puts in or gravely says nothing. He has taken
pains to be an ass, though not to be a scholar, and is at length
discovered and laughed at.</p>

<h3>A HERALD</h3>


<p>Is the spawn or indeed but the resultancy of nobility, and to the making
of him went not a generation but a genealogy. His trade is honour, and he
sells it and gives arms himself, though he be no gentleman. His bribes are
like those of a corrupt judge, for they are the prices of blood. He seems
very rich in discourse, for he tells you of whole fields of gold and
silver, or, and argent, worth much in French but in English nothing. He is
a great diver in the streams or issues of gentry, and not a by-channel or
bastard escapes him; yea he does with them like some shameless queen,
fathers more children on them than ever they begot. His traffick is a kind
of pedlary-ware, scutchions, and pennons, and little daggers and lions,
such as children esteem and gentlemen; but his penny-worths are rampant,
for you may buy three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> whole brawns cheaper than three boar's heads of him
painted. He was sometimes the terrible coat of Mars, but is now for more
merciful battles in the tilt-yard, where whosoever is victorious, the
spoils are his. He is an art in England but in Wales nature, where they
are born with heraldry in their mouths, and each name is a pedigree.</p>

<h3>THE COMMON SINGING-MEN IN CATHEDRAL CHURCHES</h3>


<p>Are a bad society, and yet a company of good fellows, that roar deep in
the quire, deeper in the tavern. They are the eight parts of speech which
go to the syntaxis of service, and are distinguished by their noises much
like bells, for they make not a concert but a peal. Their pastime or
recreation is prayers, their exercise drinking,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> yet herein so religiously
addicted that they serve God oftest when they are drunk. Their humanity is
a leg to the residencer, their learning a chapter, for they learn it
commonly before they read it; yet the old Hebrew names are little beholden
to them, for they mis-call them worse than one another. Though they never
expound the scripture, they handle it much, and pollute the gospel with
two things, their conversation and their thumbs. Upon worky-days, they
behave themselves at prayers as at their pots, for they swallow them down
in an instant. Their gowns are laced commonly with streamings of ale, the
superfluities of a cup or throat above measure. Their skill in melody
makes them the better companions abroad, and their anthems abler to sing
catches. Long lived for the most part they are not, especially the base,
they overflow their bank so oft to drown the organs. Briefly, if they
escape arresting, they die constantly in God's service; and to take their
death with more patience, they have wine and cakes at their funeral, and
now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> they keep<a name="FNanchor_73_122" id="FNanchor_73_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_122" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> the church a great deal better, and help to fill it
with their bones as before with their noise.</p>

<h3>A SHOP-KEEPER.</h3>


<p>His shop is his well stuft book, and himself the title-page of it, or
index. He utters much to all men, though he sells but to a few, and
intreats for his own necessities, by asking others what they lack. No man
speaks more and no more, for his words are like his wares, twenty of one
sort, and he goes over them alike to all commers. He is an arrogant
commender of his own things; for whatsoever he shews you is the best in
the town, though the worst in his shop. His conscience was a thing that
would have laid upon his hands, and he was forced to put it off, and
makes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> great use of honesty to profess upon. He tells you lies by rote,
and not minding, as the phrase to sell in, and the language he spent most
of his years to learn. He never speaks so truely as when he says he would
use you as his brother; for he would abuse his brother, and in his shop
thinks it lawful. His religion is much in the nature of his customers, and
indeed the pander to it: and by a mis-interpreted sense of scripture makes
a gain of his godliness. He is your slave while you pay him ready money,
but if he once befriend you, your tyrant, and you had better deserve his
hate than his trust.</p>

<h3>A BLUNT MAN</h3>


<p>Is one whose wit is better pointed than his behaviour, and that coarse and
impolished, not out of ignorance so much as humour. He is a great enemy to
the fine gentleman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> and these things of complement, and hates ceremony in
conversation, as the Puritan in religion. He distinguishes not betwixt
fair and double dealing, and suspects all smoothness for the dress of
knavery. He starts at the encounter of a salutation as an assault, and
beseeches you in choler to forbear your courtesy. He loves not any thing
in discourse that comes before the purpose, and is always suspicious of a
preface. Himself falls rudely still on his matter without any
circumstance, except he use an old proverb for an introduction. He swears
old out-of-date innocent oaths, as, by the mass! by our lady! and such
like, and though there be lords present, he cries, my masters! He is
exceedingly in love with his humour, which makes him always profess and
proclaim it, and you must take what he says patiently, because he is a
plain man. His nature is his excuse still, and other men's tyrant; for he
must speak his mind, and that is his worst, and craves your pardon most
injuriously for not pardoning you. His jests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> best become him, because
they come from him rudely and unaffected; and he has the luck commonly to
have them famous. He is one that will do more than he will speak, and yet
speak more than he will hear; for though he love to touch others, he is
touchy himself, and seldom to his own abuses replies but with his fists.
He is as squeazy<a name="FNanchor_74_123" id="FNanchor_74_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_123" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> of his commendations, as his courtesy, and his good
word is like an eulogy in a satire. He is generally better favoured than
he favours, as being commonly well expounded in his bitterness, and no man
speaks treason more securely. He chides great men with most boldness, and
is counted for it an honest fellow. He is grumbling much in the behalf of
the commonwealth, and is in prison oft for it with credit. He is generally
honest, but more generally thought so, and his downrightness credits him,
as a man not well bended and crookned to the times. In conclusion, he is
not easily bad, in whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> this quality is nature, but the counterfeit is
most dangerous, since he is disguised in a humour, that professes not to
disguise.</p>

<h3>A HANDSOME HOSTESS</h3>


<p>Is the fairer commendation of an inn, above the fair sign, or fair
lodgings. She is the loadstone that attracts men of iron, gallants and
roarers, where they cleave sometimes long, and are not easily got off. Her
lips are your welcome, and your entertainment her company, which is put
into the reckoning too, and is the dearest parcel in it. No citizen's wife
is demurer than she at the first greeting, nor draws in her mouth with a
chaster simper; but you may be more familiar without distaste, and she
does not startle at bawdry. She is the confusion of a pottle of sack more
than would have been spent elsewhere,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> and her little jugs are accepted to
have her kiss excuse them. She may be an honest woman, but is not believed
so in her parish, and no man is a greater infidel in it than her husband.</p>

<h3>A CRITIC</h3>


<p>Is one that has spelled over a great many books, and his observation is
the orthography. He is the surgeon of old authors, and heals the wounds of
dust and ignorance. He converses much in fragments and <i>desunt multa's</i>,
and if he piece it up with two lines he is more proud of that book than
the author. He runs over all sciences to peruse their syntaxis, and thinks
all learning comprised in writing Latin. He tastes stiles as some
discreeter palates do wine; and tells you which is genuine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> which
sophisticate and bastard. His own phrase is a miscellany of old words,
deceased long before the C&aelig;sars, and entombed by Varro, and the modernest
man he follows is Plautus. He writes <i>omneis</i> at length, and <i>quidquid</i>,
and his gerund is most inconformable. He is a troublesome vexer of the
dead, which after so long sparing must rise up to the judgment of his
castigations. He is one that makes all books sell dearer, whilst he swells
them into folios with his comments.<a name="FNanchor_75_124" id="FNanchor_75_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_124" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<h3>A SERGEANT, OR CATCH-POLE</h3>


<p>Is one of God's judgments; and which our roarers do only conceive
terrible. He is the properest shape wherein they fancy Satan; for he is at
most but an arrester, and hell a dungeon. He is the creditor's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> hawk,
wherewith they seize upon flying birds, and fetch them again in his
tallons. He is the period of young gentlemen, or their full stop, for when
he meets with them they can go no farther. His ambush is a shop-stall, or
close lane, and his assault is cowardly at your back. He respites you in
no place but a tavern, where he sells his minutes dearer than a
clock-maker. The common way to run from him is through him, which is often
attempted and atchieved,<a name="FNanchor_76_125" id="FNanchor_76_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_125" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> [<i>and no man is more beaten out of charity</i>.]
He is one makes the street more dangerous than the highways, and men go
better provided in their walks than their journey. He is the first handsel
of the young rapiers of the templers; and they are as proud of his repulse
as an Hungarian of killing a Turk. He is a moveable prison, and his hands
two manacles hard to be filed off. He is an occasioner of disloyal
thoughts in the commonwealth, for he makes men hate the king's name worse
than the devil's.</p>

<h3>AN UNIVERSITY DUN</h3>


<p>Is a gentleman's follower cheaply purchased, for his own money has hired
him. He is an inferior creditor of some ten shillings downwards,
contracted for horse-hire, or perchance for drink, too weak to be put in
suit, and he arrests your modesty. He is now very expensive of his time,
for he will wait upon your stairs a whole afternoon, and dance attendance
with more patience than a gentleman-usher. He is a sore beleaguerer of
chambers, and assaults them sometimes with furious knocks; yet finds
strong resistance commonly, and is kept out. He is a great complainer of
scholar's loytering, for he is sure never to find them within, and yet he
is the chief cause many times that makes them study. He grumbles at the
ingratitude of men that shun him for his kindness, but indeed it is his
own fault, for he is too great an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> upbraider. No man puts them more to
their brain than he; and by shifting him off they learn to shift in the
world. Some chuse their rooms on purpose to avoid his surprisals, and
think the best commodity in them his prospect. He is like a rejected
acquaintance, hunts those that care not for his company, and he knows it
well enough, and yet will not keep away. The sole place to supple him is
the buttery, where he takes grievous use upon your name,<a name="FNanchor_77_126" id="FNanchor_77_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_126" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and he is one
much wrought with good beer and rhetorick. He is a man of most unfortunate
voyages, and no gallant walks the streets to less purpose.</p>

<h3>A STAYED MAN</h3>


<p>Is a man: one that has taken order with himself, and sets a rule to those
lawlesnesses within him: whose life is distinct and in method, and his
actions, as it were, cast up before; not loosed into the world's vanities,
but gathered up and contracted in his station: not scattered into many
pieces of businesses, but that one course he takes, goes through with. A
man firm and standing in his purposes, not heaved off with each wind and
passion: that squares his expence to his coffers, and makes the total
first, and then the items. One that thinks what he does, and does what he
says, and foresees what he may do before he purposes. One whose "if I can"
is more than another's assurance; and his doubtful tale before some men's
protestations:&mdash;that is confident of nothing in futurity, yet his
conjectures oft true prophecies:&mdash;that makes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> a pause still betwixt his
ear and belief, and is not too hasty to say after others. One whose tongue
is strung up like a clock till the time, and then strikes, and says much
when he talks little:&mdash;that can see the truth betwixt two wranglers, and
sees them agree even in that they fall out upon:&mdash;that speaks no rebellion
in a bravery, or talks big from the spirit of sack. A man cool and
temperate in his passions, not easily betrayed by his choler:&mdash;that vies
not oath with oath, nor heat with heat, but replies calmly to an angry
man, and is too hard for him too:&mdash;that can come fairly off from captain's
companies, and neither drink nor quarrel. One whom no ill hunting sends
home discontented, and makes him swear at his dogs and family. One not
hasty to pursue the new fashion, nor yet affectedly true to his old round
breeches; but gravely handsome, and to his place, which suits him better
than his taylor: active in the world without disquiet, and careful without
misery; yet neither ingulphed in his pleasures, nor a seeker of business,
but has his hour for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> both. A man that seldom laughs violently, but his
mirth is a cheerful look: of a composed and settled countenance, not set,
nor much alterable with sadness or joy. He affects nothing so wholly, that
he must be a miserable man when he loses it; but fore-thinks what will
come hereafter, and spares fortune his thanks and curses. One that loves
his credit, not this word reputation; yet can save both without a duel.
Whose entertainments to greater men are respectful, not complementary; and
to his friends plain, not rude. A good husband, father, master; that is,
without doting, pampering, familiarity. A man well poised in all humours,
in whom nature shewed most geometry, and he has not spoiled the work. A
man of more wisdom than wittiness, and brain than fancy; and abler to any
thing than to make verses.</p>

<h3>A MODEST MAN</h3>


<p>Is a far finer man than he knows of, one that shews better to all men than
himself, and so much the better to all men, as less to himself;<a name="FNanchor_78_127" id="FNanchor_78_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_127" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> for no
quality sets a man off like this, and commends him more against his will:
and he can put up any injury sooner than this (as he calls it) your irony.
You shall hear him confute his commenders, and giving reasons how much
they are mistaken, and is angry almost if they do not believe him. Nothing
threatens him so much as great expectation, which he thinks more
prejudicial than your under-opinion, because it is easier to make that
false, than this true. He is one that sneaks from a good action, as one
that had pilfered, and dare not justify it;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> and is more blushingly
reprehended in this, than others in sin: that counts all publick
declarings of himself, but so many penances before the people; and the
more you applaud him, the more you abash him, and he recovers not his face
a month after. One that is easy to like any thing of another man's, and
thinks all he knows not of him better than that he knows. He excuses that
to you, which another would impute; and if you pardon him, is satisfied.
One that stands in no opinion because it is his own, but suspects it
rather, because it is his own, and is confuted and thanks you. He sees
nothing more willingly than his errors, and it is his error sometimes to
be too soon persuaded. He is content to be auditor, where he only can
speak, and content to go away, and think himself instructed. No man is so
weak that he is ashamed to learn of, and is less ashamed to confess it;
and he finds many times even in the dust, what others overlook and lose.
Every man's presence is a kind of bridle to him, to stop the roving of his
tongue and passions: and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> even impudent men look for this reverence from
him, and distaste that in him, which they suffer in themselves, as one in
whom vice is ill-favoured, and shews more scurvily than another. A bawdy
jest shall shame him more than a bastard another man, and he that got it
shall censure him among the rest. And he is coward to nothing more than an
ill tongue, and whosoever dare lye on him hath power over him; and if you
take him by his look, he is guilty. The main ambition of his life is not
to be discredited; and for other things, his desires are more limited than
his fortunes, which he thinks preferment, though never so mean, and that
he is to do something to deserve this. He is too tender to venture on
great places, and would not hurt a dignity to help himself: If he do, it
was the violence of his friends constrained him, how hardly soever he
obtain it, he was harder persuaded to seek it.</p>

<h3>A MEER EMPTY WIT</h3>


<p>Is like one that spends on the stock without any revenues coming in, and
will shortly be no wit at all; for learning is the fuel to the fire of
wit, which, if it wants this feeding, eats out it self. A good conceit or
two bates of such a man, and makes a sensible weakening in him; and his
brain recovers it not a year after. The rest of him are bubbles and
flashes, darted out on a sudden, which, if you take them while they are
warm, may be laughed at; if they are cool, are nothing. He speaks best on
the present apprehension, for meditation stupifies him, and the more he is
in travel, the less he brings forth. His things come off then, as in a
nauseateing stomach, where there is nothing to cast up, strains and
convulsions, and some astonishing bombasts, which men only, till they
understand, are scared with. A verse or some such work he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> may sometimes
get up to, but seldom above the stature of an epigram, and that with some
relief out of Martial, which is the ordinary companion of his pocket, and
he reads him as he were inspired. Such men are commonly the trifling
things of the world, good to make merry the company, and whom only men
have to do withal when they have nothing to do, and none are less their
friends than who are most their company. Here they vent themselves over a
cup some-what more lastingly; all their words go for jests, and all their
jests for nothing. They are nimble in the fancy of some ridiculous thing,
and reasonable good in the expression. Nothing stops a jest when it's
coming, neither friends, nor danger, but it must out howsoever, though
their blood come out after, and then they emphatically rail, and are
emphatically beaten, and commonly are men reasonable familiar to this.
Briefly they are such whose life is but to laugh and be laughed at; and
only wits in jest and fools in earnest.</p>

<h3>A DRUNKARD</h3>


<p>Is one that will be a man to-morrow morning, but is now what you will make
him, for he is in the power of the next man, and if a friend the better.
One that hath let go himself from the hold and stay of reason, and lies
open to the mercy of all temptations. No lust but finds him disarmed and
fenceless, and with the least assault enters. If any mischief escape him,
it was not his fault, for he was laid as fair for it as he could. Every
man sees him, as Cham saw his father the first of this sin, an uncovered
man, and though his garment be on, uncovered; the secretest parts of his
soul lying in the nakedest manner visible: all his passions come out now,
all his vanities, and those shamefuller humours which discretion clothes.
His body becomes at last like a miry way, where the spirits are beclogged
and cannot pass: all his members are out of office, and his heels do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> but
trip up one another. He is a blind man with eyes, and a cripple with legs
on. All the use he has of this vessel himself, is to hold thus much; for
his drinking is but a scooping in of so many quarts, which are filled out
into his body, and that filled out again into the room, which is commonly
as drunk as he. Tobacco serves to air him after a washing, and is his only
breath and breathing while. He is the greatest enemy to himself, and the
next to his friend, and then most in the act of his kindness, for his
kindness is but trying a mastery, who shall sink down first: and men come
from him as a battle, wounded and bound up. Nothing takes a man off more
from his credit, and business, and makes him more retchlesly<a name="FNanchor_79_128" id="FNanchor_79_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_128" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> careless
what becomes of all. Indeed he dares not enter on a serious thought, or if
he do, it is such melancholy that it sends him to be drunk again.</p>

<h3>A PRISON</h3>


<p>Is the grave of the living,<a name="FNanchor_80_129" id="FNanchor_80_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_129" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> where they are shut up from the world and
their friends; and the worms that gnaw upon them their own thoughts and
the jaylor. A house of meagre looks and ill smells, for lice, drink, and
tobacco are the compound. Pluto's court was expressed from this fancy; and
the persons are much about the same parity that is there. You may ask, as
Menippus in Lucian, which is Nireus, which Thersites, which the beggar,
which the knight;&mdash;for they are all suited in the same form of a kind of
nasty poverty. Only to be out at elbows is in fashion here, and a great
indecorum not to be thread-bare. Every man shews here like so many wracks
upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> sea, here the ribs of a thousand pound, here the relicks of so
many mannors, a doublet without buttons; and 'tis a spectacle of more pity
than executions are. The company one with the other is but a vying of
complaints, and the causes they have to rail on fortune and fool
themselves, and there is a great deal of good fellowship in this. They are
commonly, next their creditors, most bitter against the lawyers, as men
that have had a great stroke in assisting them hither. Mirth here is
stupidity or hard-heartedness, yet they feign it sometimes to slip
melancholy, and keep off themselves from themselves, and the torment of
thinking what they have been. Men huddle up their life here as a thing of
no use, and wear it out like an old suit, the faster the better; and he
that deceives the time best, best spends it. It is the place where new
comers are most welcomed, and, next them, ill news, as that which extends
their fellowship in misery, and leaves few to insult:&mdash;and they breath
their discontents more securely here, and have their tongues at more
liberty than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> abroad. Men see here much sin and much calamity; and where
the last does not mortify, the other hardens; as those that are worse
here, are desperately worse, and those from whom the horror of sin is
taken off and the punishment familiar: and commonly a hard thought passes
on all that come from this school; which though it teach much wisdom, it
is too late, and with danger: and it is better be a fool than come here to
learn it.</p>

<h3>A SERVING MAN</h3>


<p>Is one of the makings up of a gentleman as well as his clothes, and
somewhat in the same nature, for he is cast behind his master as
fashionably as his sword and cloak are, and he is but <i>in querpo</i><a name="FNanchor_81_130" id="FNanchor_81_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_130" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
without him. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> properness<a name="FNanchor_82_131" id="FNanchor_82_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_131" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> qualifies him, and of that a good leg;
for his head he has little use but to keep it bare. A good dull wit best
suits with him to comprehend common sense and a trencher; for any greater
store of brain it makes him but tumultuous, and seldom thrives with him.
He follows his master's steps, as well in conditions as the street; if he
wench or drink, he comes him in an under kind, and thinks it a part of his
duty to be like him. He is indeed wholly his master's; of his faction,&mdash;of
his cut,&mdash;of his pleasures:&mdash;he is handsome for his credit, and drunk for
his credit, and if he have power in the cellar, commands the parish. He is
one that keeps the best company, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> is none of it; for he knows all the
gentlemen his master knows, and picks from thence some hawking and
horse-race terms,<a name="FNanchor_83_132" id="FNanchor_83_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_132" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> which he swaggers with in the ale-house, where he is
only called master. His mirth is bawdy jests with the wenches, and, behind
the door, bawdy earnest. The best work he does is his marrying, for it
makes an honest woman, and if he follows in it his master's direction, it
is commonly the best service he does him.</p>

<h3>AN INSOLENT MAN</h3>


<p>Is a fellow newly great and newly proud; one that hath put himself into
another face upon his preferment, for his own was not bred to it. One whom
fortune hath shot up to some office or authority, and he shoots up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> his
neck to his fortune, and will not bate you an inch of either. His very
countenance and gesture bespeak how much he is, and if you understand him
not, he tells you, and concludes every period with his place, which you
must and shall know. He is one that looks on all men as if he were angry,
but especially on those of his acquaintance, whom he beats off with a
surlier distance, as men apt to mistake him, because they have known him;
and for this cause he knows not you 'till you have told him your name,
which he thinks he has heard, but forgot, and with much ado seems to
recover. If you have any thing to use him in, you are his vassal for that
time, and must give him the patience of any injury, which he does only to
shew what he may do. He snaps you up bitterly, because he will be
offended, and tells you, you are sawcy and troublesome, and sometimes
takes your money in this language. His very courtesies are intolerable,
they are done with such an arrogance and imputation; and he is the only
man you may hate after a good turn, and not be ungrateful; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> men reckon
it among their calamities to be beholden unto him. No vice draws with it a
more general hostility, and makes men readier to search into his faults,
and of them, his beginning; and no tale so unlikely but is willingly heard
of him and believed. And commonly such men are of no merit at all, but
make out in pride what they want in worth, and fence themselves with a
stately kind of behaviour from that contempt which would pursue them. They
are men whose preferment does us a great deal of wrong, and when they are
down, we may laugh at them without breach of good-nature.</p>

<h3>ACQUAINTANCE</h3>


<p>Is the first draught of a friend, whom we must lay down oft thus, as the
foul copy, before we can write him perfect and true: for from hence, as
from a probation, men take a degree in our respect, till at last they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
wholly possess us: for acquaintance is the hoard, and friendship the pair
chosen out of it; by which at last we begin to impropriate and inclose to
ourselves what before lay in common with others. And commonly where it
grows not up to this, it falls as low as may be; and no poorer relation
than old acquaintance, of whom we only ask how they do for fashion's sake,
and care not. The ordinary use of acquaintance is but somewhat a more
boldness of society, a sharing of talk, news, drink, mirth together; but
sorrow is the right of a friend, as a thing nearer our heart, and to be
delivered with it. Nothing easier than to create acquaintance, the mere
being in company once does it; whereas friendship, like children, is
ingendered by a more inward mixture, and coupling together; when we are
acquainted not with their virtues only, but their faults, their passions,
their fears, their shame,&mdash;and are bold on both sides to make their
discovery. And as it is in the love of the body, which is then at the
height and full when it has power and admittance into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> hidden and
worst parts of it; so it is in friendship with the mind, when those
<i>verenda</i> of the soul, and those things which we dare not shew the world,
are bare and detected one to another. Some men are familiar with all, and
those commonly friends to none; for friendship is a sullener thing, is a
contractor and taker up of our affections to some few, and suffers them
not loosely to be scattered on all men. The poorest tie of acquaintance is
that of place and country, which are shifted as the place, and missed but
while the fancy of that continues. These are only then gladdest of other,
when they meet in some foreign region, where the encompassing of strangers
unites them closer, till at last they get new, and throw off one another.
Men of parts and eminency, as their acquaintance is more sought for, so
they are generally more staunch of it, not out of pride only, but fear to
let too many in too near them: for it is with men as with pictures, the
best show better afar off and at distance, and the closer you come to them
the coarser they are. The best judgment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> a man is taken from his
acquaintance, for friends and enemies are both partial; whereas these see
him truest because calmest, and are no way so engaged to lie for him. And
men that grow strange after acquaintance, seldom piece together again, as
those that have tasted meat and dislike it, out of a mutual experience
disrelishing one another.</p>

<h3>A MEER COMPLIMENTAL MAN</h3>


<p>Is one to be held off still at the same distance you are now; for you
shall have him but thus, and if you enter on him farther you lose him.
Methinks Virgil well expresses him in those well-behaved ghosts that &AElig;neas
met with, that were friends to talk with, and men to look on, but if he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
grasped them, but air.<a name="FNanchor_84_133" id="FNanchor_84_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_133" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> He is one that lies kindly to you, and for good
fashion's sake, and tis discourtesy in you to believe him. His words are
so many fine phrases set together, which serve equally for all men, and
are equally to no purpose. Each fresh encounter with a man puts him to the
same part again, and he goes over to you what he said to him was last with
him: he kisses your hands as he kissed his before, and is your servant to
be commanded, but you shall intreat of him nothing. His proffers are
universal and general, with exceptions against all particulars. He will do
any thing for you, but if you urge him to this, he cannot, or to that, he
is engaged; but he will do any thing. Promises he accounts but a kind of
mannerly words, and in the expectation of your manners not to exact them:
if you do, he wonders at your ill breeding, that cannot distinguish
betwixt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> what is spoken and what is meant. No man gives better
satisfaction at the first, and comes off more with the elogy of a kind
gentleman, till you know him better, and then you know him for nothing.
And commonly those most rail at him, that have before most commended him.
The best is, he cozens you in a fair manner, and abuses you with great
respect.</p>

<h3>A POOR FIDDLER</h3>


<p>Is a man and a fiddle out of case, and he in worse case than his fiddle.
One that rubs two sticks together (as the Indians strike fire), and rubs a
poor living out of it; partly from this, and partly from your charity,
which is more in the hearing than giving him, for he sells nothing dearer
than to be gone. He is just so many strings above a beggar, though he have
but two; and yet he begs too, only not in the downright<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> 'for God's sake,'
but with a shrugging 'God bless you,' and his face is more pined than the
blind man's. Hunger is the greatest pain he takes, except a broken head
sometimes, and the labouring John Dory.<a name="FNanchor_85_134" id="FNanchor_85_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_134" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Otherwise his life is so many
fits of mirth, and tis some mirth to see him. A good feast shall draw him
five miles by the nose, and you shall track him again by the scent. His
other pilgrimages are fairs and good houses, where his devotion is great
to the Christmas; and no man loves good times better. He is in league with
the tapsters for the worshipful of the inn, whom, he torments next morning
with his art, and has their names more perfect than their men. A new song
is better to him than a new jacket, especially if bawdy, which he calls
merry; and hates naturally the puritan, as an enemy to this mirth. A
country wedding and Whitson-ale are the two main places he domineers in,
where he goes for a musician, and overlooks the bag-pipe. The rest of him
is drunk, and in the stocks.</p>

<h3>A MEDDLING MAN</h3>


<p>Is one that has nothing to do with his business, and yet no man busier
than he, and his business is most in his face. He is one thrusts himself
violently into all employments, unsent for, unfeed, and many times
unthanked; and his part in it is only an eager bustling, that rather keeps
ado than does any thing. He will take you aside, and question you of your
affair, and listen with both ears, and look earnestly, and then it is
nothing so much yours as his. He snatches what you are doing out of your
hands, and cries "give it me," and does it worse, and lays an engagement
upon you too, and you must thank him for his pains. He lays you down an
hundred wild plots, all impossible things, which you must be ruled by
perforce, and he delivers them with a serious and counselling forehead;
and there is a great deal more wisdom in this forehead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> than his head. He
will woo for you, solicit for you, and woo you to suffer him; and scarce
any thing done, wherein his letter, or his journey, or at least himself is
not seen; if he have no task in it else, he will rail yet on some side,
and is often beaten when he need not. Such men never thoroughly weigh any
business, but are forward only to shew their zeal, when many times this
forwardness spoils it, and then they cry they have done what they can,
that is, as much hurt. Wise men still deprecate these men's kindnesses,
and are beholden to them rather to let them alone; as being one trouble
more in all business, and which a man shall be hardest rid of.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<h3>A GOOD OLD MAN</h3>


<p>Is the best antiquity, and which we may with least vanity admire. One whom
time hath been thus long a working, and like winter fruit, ripened when
others are shaken down. He hath taken out as many lessons of the world as
days, and learnt the best thing in it; the vanity of it. He looks over his
former life as a danger well past, and would not hazard himself to begin
again. His lust was long broken before his body, yet he is glad this
temptation is broke too, and that he is fortified from it by this
weakness. The next door of death sads him not, but he expects it calmly as
his turn in nature; and fears more his recoiling back to childishness than
dust. All men look on him as a common father, and on old age, for his
sake, as a reverent thing. His very presence and face puts vice out of
countenance, and makes it an indecorum in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> vicious man. He practises his
experience on youth without the harshness of reproof, and in his counsel
his good company. He has some old stories still of his own seeing to
confirm what he says, and makes them better in the telling; yet is not
troublesome neither with the same tale again, but remembers with them how
oft he has told them. His old sayings and morals seem proper to his beard;
and the poetry of Cato does well out of his mouth, and he speaks it as if
he were the author. He is not apt to put the boy on a younger man, nor the
fool on a boy, but can distinguish gravity from a sour look; and the less
testy he is, the more regarded. You must pardon him if he like his own
times better than these, because those things are follies to him now that
were wisdom then; yet he makes us of that opinion too when we see him, and
conjecture those times by so good a relick. He is a man capable of a
dearness with the youngest men, yet he not youthfuller for them, but they
older for him; and no man credits more his acquaintance. He goes away at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
last too soon whensoever, with all men's sorrow but his own; and his
memory is fresh, when it is twice as old.</p>

<h3>A FLATTERER</h3>


<p>Is the picture of a friend, and as pictures flatter many times, so he oft
shews fairer than the true substance: his look, conversation, company, and
all the outwardness of friendship more pleasing by odds, for a true friend
dare take the liberty to be sometimes offensive, whereas he is a great
deal more cowardly, and will not let the least hold go, for fear of losing
you. Your meer sour look affrights him, and makes him doubt his
casheering. And this is one sure mark of him, that he is never first
angry, but ready though upon his own wrong to make satisfaction. Therefore
he is never yoked with a poor man, or any that stands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> on the lower
ground, but whose fortunes may tempt his pains to deceive him. Him he
learns first, and learns well, and grows perfecter in his humours than
himself, and by this door enters upon his soul, of which he is able at
last to take the very print and mark, and fashion his own by it, like a
false key to open all your secrets. All his affections jump<a name="FNanchor_86_135" id="FNanchor_86_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_135" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> even with
your's; he is before-hand with your thoughts, and able to suggest them
unto you. He will commend to you first what he knows you like, and has
always some absurd story or other of your enemy, and then wonders how your
two opinions should jump in that man. He will ask your counsel sometimes
as a man of deep judgment, and has a secret of purpose to disclose to you,
and whatsoever you say, is persuaded. He listens to your words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> with great
attention, and sometimes will object that you may confute him, and then
protests he never heard so much before. A piece of wit bursts him with an
overflowing laughter, and he remembers it for you to all companies, and
laughs again in the telling. He is one never chides you but for your
vertues, as, <i>you are too good, too honest, too religious</i>, when his
chiding may seem but the earnester commendation, and yet would fain chide
you out of them too; for your vice is the thing he has use of, and wherein
you may best use him; and he is never more active than in the worst
diligences. Thus, at last, he possesses you from yourself, and then
expects but his hire to betray you: and it is a happiness not to discover
him; for as long as you are happy, you shall not.</p>

<h3>A HIGH-SPIRITED MAN</h3>


<p>Is one that looks like a proud man, but is not: you may forgive him his
looks for his worth's sake, for they are only too proud to be base. One
whom no rate can buy off from the least piece of his freedom, and make him
digest an unworthy thought an hour. He cannot crouch to a great man to
possess him, nor fall low to the earth to rebound never so high again. He
stands taller on his own bottom, than others on the advantage ground of
fortune, as having solidly that honour, of which title is but the pomp. He
does homage to no man for his great stile's sake, but is strictly just in
the exaction of respect again, and will not bate you a complement. He is
more sensible of a neglect than an undoing, and scorns no man so much as
his surly threatener. A man quickly fired, and quickly laid down with
satisfaction, but remits any injury sooner than words: only to himself he
is irreconcileable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> whom he never forgives a disgrace, but is still
stabbing himself with the thought of it, and no disease that he dies of
sooner. He is one had rather perish than be beholden for his life, and
strives more to be quit with his friend than his enemy. Fortune may kill
him but not deject him, nor make him fall into an humbler key than before,
but he is now loftier than ever in his own defence; you shall hear him
talk still after thousands, and he becomes it better than those that have
it. One that is above the world and its drudgery, and cannot pull down his
thoughts to the pelting businesses of life. He would sooner accept the
gallows than a mean trade, or any thing that might disparage the height of
man in him, and yet thinks no death comparably base to hanging neither.
One that will do nothing upon command, though he would do it otherwise;
and if ever he do evil, it is when he is dared to it. He is one that if
fortune equal his worth puts a luster in all preferment; but if otherwise
he be too much crossed, turns desperately melancholy, and scorns mankind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<h3>A MEER GULL CITIZEN</h3>


<p>Is one much about the same model and pitch of brain that the clown is,
only of somewhat a more polite and finical ignorance, and as sillily
scorns him as he is sillily admired by him. The quality of the city hath
afforded him some better dress of clothes and language, which he uses to
the best advantage, and is so much the more ridiculous. His chief
education is the visits of his shop, where if courtiers and fine ladies
resort, he is infected with so much more eloquence, and if he catch one
word extraordinary, wears it for ever. You shall hear him mince a
complement sometimes that was never made for him; and no man pays dearer
for good words,&mdash;for he is oft paid with them. He is suited rather fine
than in the fashion, and has still something to distinguish him from a
gentleman, though his doublet cost more; especially on Sundays,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
bridegroom-like, where he carries the state of a very solemn man, and
keeps his pew as his shop; and it is a great part of his devotion to feast
the minister. But his chiefest guest is a customer, which is the greatest
relation he acknowledges, especially if you be an honest gentleman, that
is trust him to cozen you enough. His friendships are a kind of gossipping
friendships, and those commonly within the circle of his trade, wherein he
is careful principally to avoid two things, that is poor men and
suretiships. He is a man will spend his six-pence with a great deal of
imputation,<a name="FNanchor_87_136" id="FNanchor_87_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_136" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and no man makes more of a pint of wine than he. He is one
bears a pretty kind of foolish love to scholars, and to Cambridge
especially for Sturbridge<a name="FNanchor_88_137" id="FNanchor_88_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_137" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> fair's sake; and of these all are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> truants
to him that are not preachers, and of these the loudest the best; and he
is much ravished with the noise of a rolling tongue. He loves to hear
discourses out of his element, and the less he understands the better
pleased, which he expresses in a smile and some fond protestation. One
that does nothing without his chuck<a name="FNanchor_89_138" id="FNanchor_89_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_138" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>, that is his wife, with whom he is
billing still in conspiracy, and the wantoner she is, the more power she
has over him; and she never stoops so low after him, but is the only woman
goes better of a widow than a maid. In the education of his child no man
fearfuller, and the danger he fears is a harsh school-master, to whom he
is alledging still the weakness of the boy, and pays a fine extraordinary
for his mercy. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> first whipping rids him to the university, and from
thence rids him again for fear of starving, and the best he makes of him
is some gull in plush. He is one loves to hear the famous acts of
citizens, whereof the gilding of the cross<a name="FNanchor_90_139" id="FNanchor_90_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_139" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> he counts the glory of this
age, and the four<a name="FNanchor_91_140" id="FNanchor_91_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_140" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> prentices of London<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> above all the nine<a name="FNanchor_92_141" id="FNanchor_92_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_141" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
worthies. He intitles himself to all the merits of his company, whether
schools, hospitals, or exhibitions, in which he is joint benefactor,
though four hundred years ago, and upbraids them far more than those that
gave them: yet with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> all this folly he has wit enough to get wealth, and
in that a sufficienter man than he that is wiser.</p>

1290, by Edward I. in commemoration of the death of queen Ellinor, whose
body rested at that place, on its journey from Herdeby, in Lincolnshire,
to Westminster, for interment. It was rebuilt in 1441, and again in 1484.
In 1581, the images and ornaments were destroyed by the populace; and in
1599, the top of the cross was taken down, the timber being rotted within
the lead, and fears being entertained as to its safety. By order of queen
Elizabeth, and her privy council, it was repaired in 1600, when, says
Stow, "a cross of timber was framed, set up, covered with lead, <i>and

<h3>A LASCIVIOUS MAN</h3>


<p>Is the servant he says of many mistresses, but all are but his lust, to
which only he is faithful, and none besides, and spends his best blood and
spirits in the service. His soul is the bawd to his body, and those that
assist him in this nature the nearest to it. No man abuses more the name
of love, or those whom he applies this name to; for his love is like his
stomach to feed on what he loves, and the end of it to surfeit and loath,
till a fresh appetite rekindle him; and it kindles on any sooner than who
deserve best of him. There is a great deal of malignity in this vice, for
it loves still to spoil the best things, and a virgin sometimes rather
than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> beauty, because the undoing here is greater, and consequently his
glory. No man laughs more at his sin than he, or is so extremely tickled
with the remembrance of it; and he is more violence to a modest ear than
to her he defloured. A bawdy jest enters deep into him, and whatsoever you
speak he will draw to baudry, and his wit is never so good as here. His
unchastest part is his tongue, for that commits always what he must act
seldomer; and that commits with all which he acts with few; for he is his
own worst reporter, and men believe as bad of him, and yet do not believe
him. Nothing harder to his persuasion than a chaste man, no eunuch; and
makes a scoffing miracle at it, if you tell him of a maid. And from this
mistrust it is that such men fear marriage, or at least marry such as are
of bodies to be trusted, to whom only they sell that lust which they buy
of others, and make their wife a revenue to their mistress. They are men
not easily reformed, because they are so little ill-persuaded of their
illness, and have such pleas from man and nature. Besides it is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> jeering
and flouting vice, and apt to put jests on the reprover. The pox only
converts them, and that only when it kills them.</p>

<h3>A RASH MAN</h3>


<p>Is a man too quick for himself; one whose actions put a leg still before
his judgement, and out-run it. Every hot fancy or passion is the signal
that sets him forward, and his reason comes still in the rear. One that
has brain enough, but not patience to digest a business, and stay the
leisure of a second thought. All deliberation is to him a kind of sloth
and freezing of action, and it shall burn him rather than take cold. He is
always resolved at first thinking, and the ground he goes upon is, <i>hap
what may</i>. Thus he enters not, but throws himself violently upon all
things, and for the most part is as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> violently upon all off again; and as
an obstinate "<i>I will</i>" was the preface to his undertaking, so his
conclusion is commonly "<i>I would I had not</i>;" for such men seldom do any
thing that they are not forced to take in pieces again, and are so much
farther off from doing it, as they have done already. His friends are with
him as his physician, sought to only in his sickness and extremity, and to
help him out of that mire he has plunged himself into; for in the
suddenness of his passions he would hear nothing, and now his ill success
has allayed him he hears too late. He is a man still swayed with the first
reports, and no man more in the power of a pick-thank than he. He is one
will fight first, and then expostulate, condemn first, and then examine.
He loses his friend in a fit of quarrelling, and in a fit of kindness
undoes himself; and then curses the occasion drew this mischief upon him,
and cries, God mercy! for it, and curses again. His repentance is meerly a
rage against himself, and he does something in itself to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> be repented
again. He is a man whom fortune must go against much to make him happy,
for had he been suffered his own way, he had been undone.</p>

<h3>AN AFFECTED MAN</h3>


<p>Is an extraordinary man in ordinary things. One that would go a strain
beyond himself, and is taken in it. A man that overdoes all things with
great solemnity of circumstance; and whereas with more negligence he might
pass better, makes himself with a great deal of endeavour ridiculous. The
fancy of some odd quaintnesses have put him clean beside his nature; he
cannot be that he would, and hath lost what he was. He is one must be
point-blank in every trifle, as if his credit and opinion hung upon it;
the very space of his arms in an embrace studied before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> and premeditated,
and the figure of his countenance of a fortnight's contriving; he will not
curse you without-book and extempore, but in some choice way, and perhaps
as some great man curses. Every action of his cries,&mdash;"<i>Do ye mark me?</i>"
and men do mark him how absurd he is: for affectation is the most
betraying humour, and nothing that puzzles a man less to find out than
this. All the actions of his life are like so many things bodged in
without any natural cadence or connection at all. You shall track him all
through like a schoolboy's theme, one piece from one author and this from
another, and join all in this general, that they are none of his own. You
shall observe his mouth not made for that tone, nor his face for that
simper; and it is his luck that his finest things most misbecome him. If
he affect the gentleman as the humour most commonly lies that way, not the
least punctilio of a fine man, but he is strict in to a hair, even to
their very negligences, which he cons as rules. He will not carry a knife
with him to wound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> reputation, and pay double a reckoning, rather than
ignobly question it: and he is full of this&mdash;ignobly&mdash;and nobly&mdash;and
genteely;&mdash;and this meer fear to trespass against the genteel way puts him
out most of all. It is a humour runs through many things besides, but is
an ill-favoured ostentation in all, and thrives not:&mdash;and the best use of
such men is, they are good parts in a play.</p>

<h3>A PROFANE MAN</h3>


<p>Is one that denies God as far as the law gives him leave; that is, only
does not say so in downright terms, for so far he may go. A man that does
the greatest sins calmly, and as the ordinary actions of life, and as
calmly discourses of it again. He will tell you his business is to break
such a commandment, and the breaking of the commandment shall tempt him to
it. His words are but so many vomitings cast up to the loathsomeness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> of
the hearers, only those of his company<a name="FNanchor_93_142" id="FNanchor_93_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_142" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> loath it not. He will take upon
him with oaths to pelt some tenderer man out of his company, and makes
good sport at his conquest over the puritan fool. The scripture supplies
him for jests, and he reads it on purpose to be thus merry: he will prove
you his sin out of the bible, and then ask if you will not take that
authority. He never sees the church but of purpose to sleep in it, or when
some silly man preaches, with whom he means to make sport, and is most
jocund in the church. One that nick-names clergymen with all the terms of
reproach, as "<i>rat</i>, <i>black-coat</i>" and the like; which he will be sure to
keep up, and never calls them by other: that sings psalms when he is
drunk, and cries "<i>God mercy</i>" in mockery, for he must do it. He is one
seems to dare God in all his actions, but indeed would out-dare the
opinion of him, which would else turn him desperate; for atheism is the
refuge of such sinners, whose repentance would be only to hang
themselves.</p>

<h3>A COWARD</h3>


<p>Is the man that is commonly most fierce against the coward, and labouring
to take off this suspicion from himself; for the opinion of valour is a
good protection to those that dare not use it. No man is valianter than he
is in civil company, and where he thinks no danger may come on it, and is
the readiest man to fall upon a drawer and those that must not strike
again: wonderful exceptious and cholerick where he sees men are loth to
give him occasion, and you cannot pacify him better than by quarrelling
with him. The hotter you grow, the more temperate man is he; he protests
he always honoured you, and the more you rail upon him, the more he
honours you, and you threaten him at last into a very honest quiet man.
The sight of a sword wounds him more sensibly than the stroke, for before
that come he is dead already.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> Every man is his master that dare beat him,
and every man dares that knows him. And he that dare do this is the only
man can do much with him; for his friend he cares not for, as a man that
carries no such terror as his enemy, which for this cause only is more
potent with him of the two: and men fall out with him of purpose to get
courtesies from him, and be bribed again to a reconcilement. A man in whom
no secret can be bound up, for the apprehension of each danger loosens
him, and makes him bewray both the room and it. He is a christian meerly
for fear of hell-fire; and if any religion could fright him more, would be
of that.</p>

<h3>A SORDID RICH MAN</h3>


<p>Is a beggar of a fair estate, of whose wealth we may say as of other men's
unthriftiness, that it has brought him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> this: when he had nothing he
lived in another kind of fashion. He is a man whom men hate in his own
behalf for using himself thus, and yet, being upon himself, it is but
justice, for he deserves it. Every accession of a fresh heap bates him so
much of his allowance, and brings him a degree nearer starving. His body
had been long since desperate, but for the reparation of other men's
tables, where he hoards meats in his belly for a month, to maintain him in
hunger so long. His clothes were never young in our memory; you might make
long epochas from them, and put them into the almanack with the dear
year<a name="FNanchor_94_143" id="FNanchor_94_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_143" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and the great frost,<a name="FNanchor_95_144" id="FNanchor_95_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_144" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> he is known by them longer than his
face. He is one never gave alms in his life, and yet is as charitable to
his neighbour as himself. He will redeem a penny with his reputation, and
lose all his friends to boot; and his reason is, he will not be undone. He
never pays any thing but with strictness of law, for fear of which only he
steals not. He loves to pay short a shilling or two in a great sum, and is
glad to gain that when he can no more. He never sees friend but in a
journey to save the charges of an inn, and then only is not sick; and his
friends never see him but to abuse him. He is a fellow indeed of a kind of
frantick thrift, and one of the strangest things that wealth can work.</p>

and is thus described by that faithful and valuable historian
Holinshed:&mdash;"This yeare, about Lammas, wheat was sold at London for three
shillings the bushell: but shortlie after, it was raised to foure
shillings, fiue shillings, six shillings, and, before Christmas, to a
noble, and seuen shillings; which so continued long after. Beefe was sold
for twentie pence, and two and twentie pence the stone; and all other
flesh and white meats at an excessiue price; all kind of salt fish verie
deare, as fiue herings two pence, &amp;c.; yet great plentie of fresh fish,
and oft times the same verie cheape. Pease at foure shillings the bushell;
ote-meale at foure shillings eight pence; baie salt at three shillings the
bushell, &amp;c. All this dearth notwithstanding, (thanks be given to God,)

<h3>A MEER GREAT MAN</h3>


<p>Is so much heraldry without honour, himself less real than his title. His
virtue is, that he was his father's son, and all the expectation of him to
beget another. A man that lives meerly to preserve another's memory, and
let us know who died so many years ago. One of just as much use as his
images, only he differs in this, that he can speak himself, and save the
fellow of Westminster<a name="FNanchor_96_145" id="FNanchor_96_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_145" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> a labour: and he remembers nothing better than
what was out of his life. His grandfathers and their acts are his
discourse, and he tells them with more glory than they did them; and it is
well they did enough, or else he had wanted matter. His other studies are
his sports and those vices that are fit for great men. Every vanity of his
has his officer, and is a serious employment for his servants. He talks
loud, and baudily,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> and scurvily as a part of state, and they hear him
with reverence. All good qualities are below him, and especially learning,
except some parcels of the chronicle and the writing of his name, which he
learns to write not to be read. He is meerly of his servants' faction, and
their instrument for their friends and enemies, and is always least
thanked for his own courtesies. They that fool him most do most with him,
and he little thinks how many laugh at him bare-head. No man is kept in
ignorance more of himself and men, for he hears nought but flattery; and
what is fit to be spoken, truth with so much preface that it loses itself.
Thus he lives till his tomb be made ready, and is then a grave statue to
posterity.</p>

<h3>A POOR MAN</h3>


<p>Is the most impotent man, though neither blind nor lame, as wanting the
more necessary limbs of life, without which limbs are a burden. A man
unfenced and unsheltered from the gusts of the world, which blow all in
upon him, like an unroofed house; and the bitterest thing he suffers is
his neighbours. All men put on to him a kind of churlisher fashion, and
even more plausible natures are churlish to him, as who are nothing
advantaged by his opinion. Whom men fall out with before-hand to prevent
friendship, and his friends too to prevent engagements, or if they own him
'tis in private and a by-room, and on condition not to know them before
company. All vice put together is not half so scandalous, nor sets off our
acquaintance farther; and even those that are not friends for ends do not
love any dearness with such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> men. The least courtesies are upbraided to
him, and himself thanked for none, but his best services suspected as
handsome sharking and tricks to get money. And we shall observe it in
knaves themselves, that your beggarliest knaves are the greatest, or
thought so at least, for those that have wit to thrive by it have art not
to seem so. Now a poor man has not vizard enough to mask his vices, nor
ornament enough to set forth his virtues, but both are naked and
unhandsome; and though no man is necessitated to more ill, yet no man's
ill is less excused, but it is thought a kind of impudence in him to be
vicious, and a presumption above his fortune. His good parts lye dead upon
his hands, for want of matter to employ them, and at the best are not
commended but pitied, as virtues ill placed, and we may say of him, "Tis
an honest man, but tis pity;" and yet those that call him so will trust a
knave before him. He is a man that has the truest speculation of the
world, because all men shew to him in their plainest and worst, as a man
they have no plot on, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> appearing good to; whereas rich men are
entertained with a more holy-day behaviour, and see only the best we can
dissemble. He is the only he that tries the true strength of wisdom, what
it can do of itself without the help of fortune; that with a great deal of
virtue conquers extremities, and with a great deal more his own
impatience, and obtains of himself not to hate men.</p>

<h3>AN ORDINARY HONEST MAN</h3>


<p>Is one whom it concerns to be called honest, for if he were not this, he
were nothing: and yet he is not this neither, but a good dull vicious
fellow, that complies well with the deboshments<a name="FNanchor_97_146" id="FNanchor_97_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_146" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> of the time, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> is
fit for it. One that has no good part in him to offend his company, or
make him to be suspected a proud fellow; but is sociably a dunce, and
sociably a drinker. That does it fair and above-board without legermain,
and neither sharks<a name="FNanchor_98_147" id="FNanchor_98_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_147" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> for a cup or a reckoning: that is kind over his
beer, and protests he loves you, and begins to you again, and loves you
again. One that quarrels with no man, but for not pledging him, but takes
all absurdities and commits as many, and is no tell-tale next morning,
though he remember it. One that will fight for his friend if he hear him
abused, and his friend commonly is he that is most likely, and he lifts up
many a jug in his defence. He rails against none but censurers, against
whom he thinks he rails lawfully, and censurers are all those that are
better than himself. These good properties qualify him for honesty enough,
and raise him high in the ale-house commendation, who, if he had any other
good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> quality, would be named by that. But now for refuge he is an honest
man, and hereafter a sot: only those that commend him think him not so,
and those that commend him are honest fellows.</p>

<h3>A SUSPICIOUS OR JEALOUS MAN</h3>


<p>Is one that watches himself a mischief, and keeps a lear eye still, for
fear it should escape him. A man that sees a great deal more in every
thing than is to be seen, and yet he thinks he sees nothing: his own eye
stands in his light. He is a fellow commonly guilty of some weaknesses,
which he might conceal if he were careless:&mdash;now his over-diligence to
hide them makes men pry the more. Howsoever he imagines you have found
him, and it shall go hard but you must abuse him whether you will or no.
Not a word can be spoke, but nips him somewhere;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> not a jest thrown out,
but he will make it hit him. You shall have him go fretting out of
company, with some twenty quarrels to every man, stung and galled, and no
man knows less the occasion than they that have given it. To laugh before
him is a dangerous matter, for it cannot be at any thing but at him, and
to whisper in his company plain conspiracy. He bids you speak out, and he
will answer you, when you thought not of him. He expostulates with you in
passion, why you should abuse him, and explains to your ignorance wherein,
and gives you very good reason at last to laugh at him hereafter. He is
one still accusing others when they are not guilty, and defending himself
when he is not accused: and no man is undone more with apologies, wherein
he is so elaborately excessive, that none will believe him; and he is
never thought worse of, than when he has given satisfaction. Such men can
never have friends, because they cannot trust so far; and this humour hath
this infection with it, it makes all men to them suspicious. In
conclusion, they are men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> always in offence and vexation with themselves
and their neighbours, wronging others in thinking they would wrong them,
and themselves most of all in thinking they deserve it.</p>

<h3>SOME ACCOUNT OF BISHOP EARLE<a name="FNanchor_AX_148" id="FNanchor_AX_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_AX_148" class="fnanchor">[AX]</a>.</h3>


<p>All the biographical writers who have taken notice of <span class="smcap">John Earle</span> agree in
stating, that he was born in the city of York, although not one of them
has given the exact date of his birth, or any intelligence relative to his
family, or the rank in life of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> his parents. It is, however, most
probable, that they were persons of respectability and fortune, as he was
sent, at an early age, to Oxford, and entered as a commoner of
Christ-church college<a name="FNanchor_AY_149" id="FNanchor_AY_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_AY_149" class="fnanchor">[AY]</a>, where his conduct was so exemplary, his
attention to his studies so marked, and his general deportment and manners
so pleasing, that he became a successful candidate at Merton-college, and
was admitted a probationary fellow on that foundation in 1620, being then,
according to Wood<a name="FNanchor_AZ_150" id="FNanchor_AZ_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_AZ_150" class="fnanchor">[AZ]</a>, about nineteen years of age. He took the degree of
Master of Arts, July 10, 1624, and in 1631 served the office of Proctor of
the university, about which time he was also appointed chaplain to Philip
Earl of Pembroke, then Chancellor of Oxford.</p>

<p>During the earlier part of our author's life, he appears to have possessed
considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> reputation as a poet, and to have been as remarkable for the
pleasantry of his conversation, as for his learning, virtues, and piety.
Wood<a name="FNanchor_BA_151" id="FNanchor_BA_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_BA_151" class="fnanchor">[BA]</a> tells us that "his younger years were adorned with oratory,
poetry, and witty fancies, his elder with quaint preaching and subtile
disputes." The only specimens of his poetry which can be recovered at this
time, are three funeral tributes, which will be found in the Appendix, and
of which two are now printed, I believe, for the first time.</p>

<p>Soon after his appointment to be Lord Pembroke's chaplain, he was
presented by that nobleman to the rectory of Bishopstone, in Wiltshire;
nor was this the only advantage he reaped from the friendship of his
patron, who being at that time Lord Chamberlain of the King's
household<a name="FNanchor_BB_152" id="FNanchor_BB_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_BB_152" class="fnanchor">[BB]</a>, was entitled to a lodging in the court for his chaplain, a
circumstance which in all probability introduced Mr. Earle to the notice
of the King, who promoted him to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> chaplain and tutor to Prince Charles,
when Dr. Duppa, who had previously discharged that important trust, was
raised to the bishopric of Salisbury.</p>

<p>In 1642 Earle took his degree of Doctor in Divinity, and in the year
following was actually elected one of the Assembly of Divines appointed by
the parliament to new model the church. This office, although it may be
considered a proof of the high opinion even those of different sentiments
from himself entertained of his character and merit, he refused to accept,
when he saw that there was no probability of assisting the cause of
religion, or of restraining the violence of a misguided faction, by an
interference among those who were "declared and avowed enemies to the
doctrine and discipline of the Church of England; some of them infamous in
their lives and conversations, and most of them of very mean parts in
learning, if not of scandalous ignorance<a name="FNanchor_BC_153" id="FNanchor_BC_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_BC_153" class="fnanchor">[BC]</a>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 10th of February, 1643, Dr. Earle was elected chancellor of the
cathedral of Salisbury<a name="FNanchor_BD_154" id="FNanchor_BD_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_BD_154" class="fnanchor">[BD]</a>, of which situation, as well as his living of
Bishopstone, he was shortly after deprived by the ill success of the royal
cause<a name="FNanchor_BE_155" id="FNanchor_BE_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_BE_155" class="fnanchor">[BE]</a>.</p>

<p>When the defeat of the King's forces at Worcester compelled Charles the
Second to fly his country, Earle attached himself to the fallen fortunes
of his sovereign, and was among the first of those who saluted him upon
his arrival at Rouen in Normandy, where he was made clerk of the closet,
and King's chaplain<a name="FNanchor_BF_156" id="FNanchor_BF_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_BF_156" class="fnanchor">[BF]</a>. Nor was his affection to the family of the
Stuarts, and his devotion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> to their cause evinced by personal services
only, as we find by a letter from Lord Clarendon to Dr. Barwick, that he
assisted the King with money in his necessities<a name="FNanchor_BG_157" id="FNanchor_BG_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_BG_157" class="fnanchor">[BG]</a>.</p>

<p>During the time that Charles was in Scotland, Dr. Earle resided in
Antwerp, with his friend Dr. Morley<a name="FNanchor_BH_158" id="FNanchor_BH_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_BH_158" class="fnanchor">[BH]</a>, from whence he was called upon to
attend the Duke of York (afterwards James II.) at Paris<a name="FNanchor_BI_159" id="FNanchor_BI_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_BI_159" class="fnanchor">[BI]</a>, in order that
he might heal some of the breaches which were then existing between
certain members of the duke's household<a name="FNanchor_BJ_160" id="FNanchor_BJ_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_BJ_160" class="fnanchor">[BJ]</a>; and here it is probable he
remained till the recal of Charles the Second to the throne of England.</p>

<p>Upon the Restoration, Dr. Earle received the reward of his constancy and
loyalty, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> was immediately promoted to the deanery of Westminster, a
situation long designed for him by the King<a name="FNanchor_BK_161" id="FNanchor_BK_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_BK_161" class="fnanchor">[BK]</a>. In 1661 he was appointed
one of the commissioners for a review of the Liturgy<a name="FNanchor_BL_162" id="FNanchor_BL_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_BL_162" class="fnanchor">[BL]</a>, and on November
30, 1662, was consecrated Bishop of Worcester, from which see he was
translated, September 28, 1663, to the dignity of Salisbury<a name="FNanchor_BM_163" id="FNanchor_BM_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_BM_163" class="fnanchor">[BM]</a>.</p>

<p>Little more remains to be added.&mdash;Bishop Earle appears to have continued
his residence with the royal family after the acquisition of his
well-deserved honours; and when the court retired to Oxford, during the
plague in 1665, he attended their majesties to the place of his early
education, and died at his apartments in University College, on the 17th
of November. He was buried on the 25th, near the high altar, in Merton
College chapel; and was, according to Wood, "accompanied to his grave,
from the public schools, by an herald at arms, and the principal persons
of the court and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> university." His monument, which stands at the
north-east corner of the chapel, is still in excellent preservation, and
possesses the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<h3>CHARACTERS OF BISHOP EARLE.</h3>


<p>&mdash;&mdash;"He was a person very notable for his elegance in the Greek and Latin
tongues; and being fellow of Merton college in Oxford, and having been
proctor of the university, and some very witty and sharp discourses being
published in print without his consent, though known to be his, he grew
suddenly into a very general esteem with all men; being a man of great
piety and devotion; a most eloquent and powerful preacher; and of a
conversation so pleasant and delightful, so very innocent, and so very
facetious, that no man's company was more desired, and more loved. No man
was more negligent in his dress, and habit, and mein; no man more wary and
cultivated in his behaviour and discourse; insomuch as he had the greater
advantage when he was known, by promising so little before he was known.
He was an excellent poet both in Latin, Greek, and English, as appears by
many pieces yet abroad; though he suppressed many more himself, especially
of English, incomparably good, out of an austerity to those sallies of his
youth. He was very dear to the Lord Falkland, with whom he spent as much
time as he could make his own; and as that lord would impute the speedy
progress he made in the Greek tongue to the information and assistance he
had from Mr. Earles, so Mr. Earles would frequently profess that he had
got more useful learning by his conversation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span> at Tew (the Lord Falkland's
house,) than he had at Oxford. In the first settling of the prince his
family, he was made one of his chaplains, and attended on him when he was
forced to leave the kingdom. He was amongst the few excellent men who
never had, nor ever could have, an enemy, but such a one who was an enemy
to all learning and virtue, and therefore would never make himself known."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Clarendon.</span> <i>Account of his own Life</i>, folio, Oxford, 1759, p. 26.</p>

<hr style='width: 35%;' />

<p>&mdash;&mdash;"This is that Dr. Earle, who from his youth (I had almost said from
his childhood,) for his natural and acquired abilities was so very eminent
in the university of Oxon; and after was chosen to be one of the first
chaplains to his Majesty (when Prince of Wales): who knew not how to
desert his master, but with duty and loyalty (suitable to the rest of his
many great virtues, both moral and intellectual,) faithfully attended his
Majesty both at home and abroad, as chaplain, and clerk of his majesty's
closet, and upon his majesty's happy return, was made Dean of Westminster,
and now Lord Bishop of Worcester, (for which, December 7, he did homage to
his Majesty,) having this high and rare felicity by his excellent and
spotless conversation, to have lived so many years in the court of
England, so near his Majesty, and yet not given the least offence to any
man alive; though both in and out of pulpit he used all Christian freedom
against the vanities of this age, being honoured and admired by all who
have either known, heard, or read him."</p>

<hr style='width: 35%;' />
<p>&mdash;&mdash;"Dr. Earle, now Lord Bishop of Salisbury, of whom I may justly say,
(and let it not offend him, because it is such a truth as ought not to be
concealed from posterity, or those that now live and yet know him not,)
that, since Mr. Hooker died, none have lived whom God hath blessed with
more innocent wisdom, more sanctified learning, or a more pious,
peaceable, primitive temper: so that this excellent person seems to be
only like himself, and our venerable Richard Hooker."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BN_164" id="Footnote_BN_164"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BN_164"><span class="label">[BN]</span></a> Besides the pieces above noticed, several smaller poems were
undoubtedly in circulation during Earle's life, the titles of which are
not preserved. Wood supposes (<i>Ath. Oxon.</i>) our author to have contributed
to "<i>some of the Figures, of which about ten were published</i>" but is
ignorant of the exact numbers to be attributed to his pen. In the
Bodleian<a name="FNanchor_BO_165" id="FNanchor_BO_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_BO_165" class="fnanchor">[BO]</a> is "<i>The Figvre of Fovre: Wherein are sweet flowers, gathered
out of that fruitfull ground, that I hope will yeeld pleasure and profit
to all sorts of people. The second Part, London, Printed for Iohn Wright,
and are to bee sold at his shop without Newgate, at the signe of the
Bible, 1636.</i>" This, however, was undoubtedly one of Breton's productions,
as his initials are affixed to the preface. It is in 12mo. and consists of
twenty pages, not numbered. The following extracts will be sufficient to
shew the nature of the volume.
</p><p>
"There are foure persons not to be believed: a horse-courser when he
sweares, a whore when shee weepes, a lawyer when he pleads false, and a
traveller when he tels wonders.
</p><p>
"There are foure great cyphers in the world: hee that is lame among
dancers, dumbe among lawyers, dull among schollers and rude amongst
courtiers
</p><p>
"Foure things grievously empty: a head without braines, a wit without
judgment, a heart without honesty, and a purse without money."
</p><p>
Ant. Wood possessed the <i>figure of six</i>, which, however, is now not to be
found among his books left to the university of Oxford, and deposited in
Ashmole's museum. That it once was there, is evident from the MS.
catalogue of that curious collection.</p></div>

<span class="i0">Come, Pembroke lives! Oh! do not fright our ears<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Welcome, sad weeds&mdash;but he that mourns for thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must bring an eye that can weep elegy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A look that would save blacks: whose heavy grace<br /></span>

<h3>ON MR. BEAUMONT.</h3>

<p class='center'>WRITTEN THIRTY YEARS SINCE, PRESENTLY AFTER HIS DEATH.</p>

<p>[<i>From "Comedies and Tragedies written by Francis Beaumont and John
Fletcher, Gentlemen" folio. London. 1647.</i>]</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beaumont lies here: And where now shall we have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A muse like his to sigh upon his grave?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! none to weep this with a worthy tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he that cannot, <i>Beaumont</i> that lies here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who now shall pay thy tomb with such a verse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thou that lady's didst, fair <i>Rutland's</i> herse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A monument that will then lasting be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all her marble is more dust than she.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thee all's lost: a sudden dearth and want<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath seiz'd on wit, good epitaphs are scant.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We dare not write thy elegy, whilst each fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ne'er shall match that copy of thy tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce in an age a poet, and yet he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce live the third part of his age to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But quickly taken off and only known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is in a minute shut as soon as shown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should weak Nature tire herself in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such a piece, to dash it straight again?<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Why should she take such work beyond her skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, when she cannot perfect, she must kill?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! what is't to temper slime and mire?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Nature's puzzled when she works in fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great brains (like brightest glass) crack straight, while those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of stone or wood hold out, and fear not blows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we their ancient hoary heads can see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose wit was never their mortality.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Beaumont</i> dies young, so <i>Sidney</i> did before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was not poetry he could live to more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could not grow up higher, I scarce know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If th' art itself unto that pitch could grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were't not in thee that hadst arriv'd the height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all that wit could reach, or nature might.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O when I read those excellent things of thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such strength, such sweetness couched in ev'ry line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such life of fancy, such high choice of brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought of the vulgar wit or borrow'd strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such passion, such expressions meet my eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such wit untainted with obscenity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these so unaffectedly exprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in a language purely flowing drest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all so born within thyself, thine own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So new, so fresh, so nothing trod upon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I grieve not now that old <i>Menander's</i> vein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is ruin'd to survive in thee again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such, in his time, was he of the same piece,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smooth, even, nat'ral wit and love of Greece.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those few sententious fragments shew more worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all the poets Athens e'er brought forth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am sorry we have lost those hours<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
<span class="i0">On them, whose quickness comes far short of ours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dwell not more on thee, whose ev'ry page<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be a pattern for their scene and stage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will not yield thy works so mean a praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More pure, more chaste, more sainted than are plays:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor with that dull supineness to be read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pass a fire, or laugh an hour in bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How do the Muses suffer every where,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taken in such mouth's censure, in such ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That 'twixt a whiff, a line or two rehearse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with their rheume together spaul a verse?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This all a poem's leisure after play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink, or tobacco, it may keep the day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst ev'n their very idleness they think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is lost in these, that lose their time in drink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pity then dull we, we that better know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will a more serious hour on thee bestow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should not <i>Beaumont</i> in the morning please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well as <i>Plautus</i>, <i>Aristophanes</i>?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, if my pen may as my thoughts be free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were scurril wits and buffoons both to thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet these our learned of severest brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will deign to look on, and to note them too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That will defy our own, 'tis English stuff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And th' author is not rotten long enough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! what phlegm are they compar'd to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thy <i>Philaster</i>, and <i>Maid's-Tragedy</i>?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where's such a humour as thy <i>Bessus</i>? pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let them put all their <i>Thrasoes</i> in one play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall out-bid them; their conceit was poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in a circle of a bawd or whore;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A coz'ning dance; take the fool away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not a good jest extant in a play.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet these are wits, because they'r old, and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being Greek and Latin, they are learning too:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But those their own times were content t'allow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thirsty fame, and thine is lowest now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou shalt live, and, when thy name is grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six ages older, shall be better known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When th' art of <i>Chaucer's</i> standing in the tomb,<br /></span>

<p>Serenissime Rex,</p>

<p>Prodeat jam sub tuis auspiciis illa patris tui gloriosissimi imago, illa
qu&acirc; magis ad Dei similitudinem, qu&agrave;m qu&agrave; Rex aut homo accedit. Prodeat
vero eo colore peregrino, quo facta omnibus conspectior fiat publica. Ita
enim tu voluisti, ut sic lingua omnium communi orbi traderem, in qua
utinam feliciorem tibi operam navare licuisset, ut illam nativam
elegantiam, illam vim verborum et lumina, illam admirabilem sermonis
structuram exprimerem. Quod cum fieri (fortasse nec a peritissimis) &agrave; me
cert&egrave; non possit, pr&aelig;stat interim ut cum aliqua venustatis injuria magnam
partem Europ&aelig; alloquatur, quam intra paucos su&aelig; gentis clausa apud c&aelig;teros
omnes conticescat. Sunt enim hic velut qu&aelig;dam Dei magnalia qu&aelig; spargi
expedit humano generi, et in omnium linguis exaudiri: id pro mea facultate
curavi, ut si non sensa tanti authoris ornat&egrave;, at perspicu&egrave; et fid&egrave;
traderem, imo nec ab ipsa dictione<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> et phrasi (quantum Latini idiomatis
ratio permittit) vel minimum recederem. Sacri enim codicis religiosum esse
decet interpretem: et certe proxime ab illo sacro et adorando codice, (qui
in has comparationes non cadit,) <a href="#ADDITIONAL_NOTES_AND_CORRECTIONS">spera</a> non me audacem futurum, si dixero
nullum inter c&aelig;teros mortalium, vel autore vel argumento illustriorem, vel
in quo viva magis pietas et eximie Christiana spiratur.</p>

<p>Habet vero sanctitas regia nescio quid ex fortun&aelig; su&aelig; majestate sublimius
quiddain et augustius, et qu&aelig; imperium magis obtinet in mentes hominum, et
reverentia majore accipitur: quare et his maxime instrumentis usus est

traditam pietatem. Quod et libro huic evenit, et erit magis eventurum, quo
jam multo diffusior plures sui capaces invenerit.</p>

<p>Magnum erat profecto sic meditari, sic scribere; multo majus sic vivere,

probro et scelere conjunxistis. Nemo unquam ab orbe condito tot veris
omnium lacrymis, tot sinceris laudibus celebratus est. Nulli unquam
principum in secundis agenti illos fictos plausus vel metus dedit, vel
adulatio vendidit, qu&agrave;m hic verissimos expressere fuga, carcer, theatrum
et illa omnium funestissima securis, qua obstupe, fecit hostes moriens et

<p>Tu interim (Rex augustissime) vera et viva patris effigies, (cujus inter
summas erat felicitates humanas, et in adversis solatium te genuisse, in
quo superstite mori non potest) inflammeris maxime hoc mortis illius

ego) quam in heroic&aelig; virtutis, et constanti&aelig; zelum: hanc vero primum adeas
quam nulla vis tibi invito eripiet, h&aelig;reditariam pietatem; et quo es in
tuos omnes affectu maxime philostorgo, hunc librum eodem tecum genitore

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BS_169" id="Footnote_BS_169"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BS_169"><span class="label">[BS]</span></a> Peter Heylin was born at Burford, in Oxfordshire, Nov. 29,
1599 and received the rudiments of his education at the free school in
that place, from whence he removed to Harthall, and afterwards obtained a
fellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford. By the interposition of Bishop
Laud, to whom he was recommended by Lord Danvers, he was presented first
to the rectory of Hemingford, in Huntingdonshire, then to a prebend of
Westminster, and lastly to the rectory of Houghton in the Spring, in the
diocese of Durham, which latter he exchanged for Alresford, in Hampshire.
In 1633 he proceeded D. D. and in 1638, became rector of South
Warnborough, Hampshire, by exchange with Mr. Atkinson, of St. John's
College, for Islip, in Oxfordshire. In 1640 he was chosen clerk of the
convocation for Westminster, and in 1642 followed the king to Oxford.
After the death of Charles, he lost all his property, and removing with
his family from place to place, subsisted by the exercise of his pen till
the Restoration, when he regained his livings, and was made sub-dean of
Westminster. His constancy and exertions were supposed by many to merit a
higher reward, from a government, in whose defence he had sacrificed every
prospect; but the warmth of his temper, and his violence in dispute, were
such as rendered his promotion to a higher dignity in the church impolitic
in the opinion of the ministers. He died May 8, 1662, and was interred in
Westminster-abbey, under his own stall. A list of his numerous
publications, as well as a character of him, may be found in Wood's
<i>Athen&aelig; Oxonienses</i>, ii. 275.</p></div>

<h3>CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN DR. EARLE AND MR. BAXTER.</h3>

<p class='center'>[<i>See Kennet's Register, folio, Lond. 1723, page 713.</i>]</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'>MR. BAXTER TO DR. EARLE.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">REVEREND SIR</span>,</p>

<p>"By the great favour of my lord chancellor's reprehension, I came to
understand how long a time I have suffered in my reputation with my
superiors by your misunderstanding me, and misinforming others; as if when
I was to preach before the king, I had scornfully refused the tippet as a
toy; when, as the Searcher and Judge of Hearts doth know, that I had no
such thought or word. I was so ignorant in those matters as to think that
a tippet had been a proper ensign of a doctor of divinity, and I verily
thought that you offered it me as such: and I had so much pride as to be
somewhat ashamed when you offered it me, that I must tell you my want of
such degrees; and therefore gave you no answer to your first offer, but to
your second was forced to say, "It belongeth not to me, Sir." And I said
not to you any more; nor had any other thought in my heart than with some
shame to tell you that I had no degrees, imagining I should have offended
others, and made myself the laughter or scorn of many, if I should have
used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> that which did not belong to me. For I must profess that I had no
more scruple to wear a tippet than a gown, or any comely garment. Sir,
though this be one of the smallest of all the mistakes which of late have
turned to my wrong, and I must confess that my ignorance gave you the
occasion, and I am far from imputing it to any ill will in you, having
frequently heard, that in charity, and gentleness, and peaceableness of
mind you are very eminent; yet because I must not contemn my estimation
with my superiors, I humbly crave that favour and justice of you, (which I
am confident you will readily grant me,) as to acquaint those with the
truth of this business, whom, upon mistake, you have misinformed, whereby
in relieving the innocence of your brother, you will do a work of charity
and justice, and therefore not displeasing unto God, and will much oblige,</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p class='center'>Your humble servant,</p>

<p class='right'><span class="smcap">Richard Baxter</span>.</p>

<p><i>June 20, 1662.</i></p>

<p><i>P. S.</i> I have the more need of your justice in this case, because my
distance denieth me access to those that have received these misreports,
and because any public vindication of myself, whatever is said of me, is
taken as an unsufferable crime, and therefore I am utterly incapable of
vindicating my innocency, or remedying their mistakes.</p>

<p>"To the reverend and much honoured Dr. Earles,<br />
Dean of Westminster, &amp;c. These."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'>DR EARLE, IN REPLY.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'><i>Hampton-Court, June 23.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<div class="sidenote">O that they were all such.&mdash;<i>Note by Mr. Baxter.</i></div>

<p>"I received your letter, which I would have answered sooner, if the
messenger that brought it had returned. I must confess I was a little
surprized with the beginning of it, as I was with your name; but when I
read further I ceased to be so. Sir, I should be heartily sorry and
ashamed to be guilty of any thing like malignity or uncharitableness,
especially to one of your condition, with whom, though I concur not
perhaps in point of judgment in some particulars, yet I cannot but esteem
for your personal worth and abilities; and, indeed, your expressions in
your letter are so civil and ingenuous, that I am obliged thereby the more
to give you all the satisfaction I can.</p>

<div class="sidenote">These words I heard not, being in the passage from him.&mdash;<i>Note
by Mr. Baxter.</i></div>

<p>As I remember, then, when you came to me to the closet, and I told you I
would furnish you with a tippet, you answered me something to that purpose
as you write, but whether the same numerical words, or but once, I cannot
possibly say from my own memory, and therefore I believe yours. Only this
I am sure of, that I said to you at my second speaking, that some others
of your persuasion had not scrupled at it, which might suppose (if you had
not affirmed the contrary), that you had made me a formal refusal; of
which giving me then no other reason than that "it belonged not to you," I
concluded that you were more scrupulous than others were. And, perhaps,
the manner of your refusing it (as it appeared to me) might make me think
you were not very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> well pleased with the motion. And this it is likely I
might say, either to my lord chancellor or others; though seriously I do
not remember that I spake to my lord chancellor at all concerning it. But,
sir, since you give me now that modest reason for it, (which, by the way,
is no just reason in itself, for a tippet may be worn without a degree,
though a hood cannot; and it is no shame at all to want these formalities
for him that wanteth not the substance,) but, sir, I say, since you give
that reason for your refusal, I believe you, and shall correct that
mistake in myself, and endeavour to rectify it in others, if any, upon
this occasion, have misunderstood you. In the mean time I shall desire
your charitable opinion of myself, which I shall be willing to deserve
upon any opportunity that is offered me to do you service, being, sir,</p>

<p>[4to. black letter, containing thirty folios, very incorrectly numbered.]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>I commence my list of <i>Characters</i>, with a volume, which, although earlier
than the period I originally intended to begin from, is of sufficient
curiosity and interest to warrant introduction, and, I trust, to obtain
pardon from the reader for the additional trouble I am thus preparing for
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Warton, in his <i>History of English Poetry</i>, (iv. 74.) has given, with
some trifling errors, a transcript of the title, and says he has a faint
remembrance of a Collection of Epigrams, by the author, printed about
1599: these I have never been fortunate enough to meet with, nor do they
appear in the collections of Ames or Herbert, neither of whom had seen a
copy of the present work, although they mention Griffith's licence to
print it as dated in 1566<a name="FNanchor_BV_172" id="FNanchor_BV_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_BV_172" class="fnanchor">[BV]</a>.</p>

<p>It is dedicated to Elizabeth, countess of Shrewsbury; Mr. Warton thinks
"with singular impropriety," although the motive appears at least to
justify the measure, if it does not entitle the author to commendation. He
addresses this noble lady as a person of extreme benevolence, and "as also
aboundantly powrynge out dayly [her] ardent and bountifull charytie vppon
all such as commeth for reliefe."&mdash;"I thought it good," he continues,
"necessary, and my bounden dutye, to acquaynte your goodnes with the
abhominable, wycked, and detestable behauor of all these rowsey, ragged
rabblement of rake helles, that vnder the pretence of great misery,
dyseases, and other innumerable calamites whiche they fayne through great
hipocrisye, do wyn and gayne great almes in all places where they wyly
wander."&mdash;On this account, therefore, and to preserve the kindness and
liberality of the countess from imposition, Harman dedicates his book to
that lady.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>The notorious characters mentioned, are a "ruffler<a name="FNanchor_BW_173" id="FNanchor_BW_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_BW_173" class="fnanchor">[BW]</a>; a upright man<a name="FNanchor_BX_174" id="FNanchor_BX_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_BX_174" class="fnanchor">[BX]</a>;

walking morte; a doxe; a dell; a kynchin morte; and a kynchen co."</p>

<p>From such a list, several instances of the tricks, as well as specimens of
the language of the thieves of the day, might with ease be extracted, did
not the limits of my little volume compel me to refrain from entering at
large into this history of rogues; a restriction I the more regret, from
its containing several passages illustrating the manners of that period,
and which would be found of material use towards explaining many of the
allusions met with in our early English dramas and now but imperfectly
understood.</p>


<p>"&para; Prygger of Prauncers. (Sign. C. iii. b.)</p>

<p>"A prigger of Prauncers be horse stealers, for to prigge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> signifieth in
their language to steale, and a prauncer is a horse, so beinge put
together, the matter is plaine. These go commonly in jerkins of leather or
of white frese, &amp; carry little wandes in their hands, and will walke
through grounds and pasturs, to search and se horses mete for their
purpose. And if thei chaunce to be met and asked by the owners of the
grounde what they make there, they fayne straighte that they have loste
theyr waye, and desyre to be enstructed the beste way to suche a place.
These will also repayre to gentlemens houses, and aske theyr charitye, and
will offer theyr seruice. And if you aske them what they can doe, they wil
saye that they can kepe two or three geldinges, and waite vppon a
gentleman. These haue also theyr women that, walkinge from them in other
places, marke where and what they see abrode, and sheweth these priggars
therof, when they meete, whych is wythin a weeke or two. And loke, where
they steale any thynge, they conuey the same at the leaste three score
miles of, or more. There was a gentleman, a verye friende of myne, rydynge
from London homewarde into Kente, hauinge within three myles of his house
busynesse, alyghted of his horse, and hys man also, in a pretye village,
where diuers houses were, and looked about hym where he myghte haue a
conuenyent person to walke his horse, because he would speak we a farmer
that dwelte on the backe side of the sayde village, little aboue a quarter
of a myle from the place where he lighted, and had his man to waight vpon
hym, as it was mete for his callynge: espieng a priggar there standing,
thinkinge the same to dwel there, charging this prity prigginge person to
walke his horse well, and that they might not stande still for takynge of
colde, and at his returne (which he saide should not be longe,) he would
geue him a peny to drinke, and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> wente about his busines. Thys peltynge
priggar, proude of his praye, walketh hys horses vp and downe, till he
sawe the gentleman out of sighte, and leapes him into the saddell, and
awaye be goeth a mayne. This gentleman returning, and findyng not his
horses, sente his man to the one ende of the village, &amp; he went himselfe
vnto the other ende, and enquired as he went for hys horses that were
walked, and began somewhat to suspecte, because neither he nor his man
coulde neyther see nor fynde him. Then this gentleman diligently enquired
of three or foure towne dwellers there whether any such person, declaring
his stature, age, apparel, and so manye linamentes of his body as he
coulde call to remembraunce. And <i>vna voce</i>, all sayde that no such man
dwelte in their streate, neither in the parish that they knewe of, but
some did wel remember that suche a one they sawe there lyrkinge and
huggeringe<a name="FNanchor_CL_188" id="FNanchor_CL_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_CL_188" class="fnanchor">[CL]</a> two houres before the gentleman came thether and a
straunger to them. J had thought, quoth this gentleman, he had here
dwelled, and marched home mannerly in his botes: farre from the place he
dwelt not. J suppose at his comming home he sente such wayes as he
suspected or thought mete to search for this prigger, but hetherto he
neuer harde any tidinges againe of his palfreys. J had the best gelding
stolen out of my pasture that J had amogst others, while this boke was
first a printing."</p>

<p>At the end of the several characters, the author gives a list of the names
of the most notorious thieves of his day, a collection of the cant phrases
used by them, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span> their significations; and a dialogue between an

<p>I have been induced, from the curiosity and rarity of this tract, to
extend my account of it farther, perhaps, than many of my readers may
think reasonable, and shall, therefore, only add a specimen of Harman's
poetry, with which the original terminates.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&#9758; Thus J conclude my bolde beggar's booke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all estates most playnely maye see;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To amende their mysdeedes, and so lyue vnharmed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another tract of the same description is noticed in Herbert's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span> Ames (p.
885.) as printed so early as in 1565. A copy of the second edition in the
Bodleian Library, possesses the following title:&mdash;"<i>The Fraternitye of
Uacabondes. As wel of ruflyng Vacabondes, as of beggerly, of women as of
men, of gyrles as of boyes, with their proper names and qualities. With a
description of the crafty company of Cousoners and Shifters. Whereunto
also is adioyned the xxv orders of Knaues, otherwyse called a Quartern of
Knaues. Confirmed for euer by Cocke Lorell<a name="FNanchor_CM_189" id="FNanchor_CM_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_CM_189" class="fnanchor">[CM]</a>, &amp;c. Imprinted at London by
Iohn Awdeley, dwellyng in little Britayne streete without Aldersgate.
1575.</i>" This, although much shorter than Harman's, contains nearly the
same characters, and is therefore thus briefly dismissed. An account of
it, drawn up by the editor of the present volume, may be found in Brydges'
<i>British Bibliographer</i>, vol. ii. p. 12.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to notice in this place, that a considerable part of
<i>The Belman of London, bringing to light the most notorious villanies that
are now practised in the kingdom, &amp;c.</i> 4to. 1608, is derived from Harman's
<i>Caveat</i>. Among the books bequeathed to the Bodleian, by Burton, (4to.
G.8. Art. BS.) is a copy of the <i>Belman</i>, with the several passages so
borrowed, marked in the hand-writing of the author of the <i>Anatomy of
Melancholy</i>, who has also copied the <i>canting dialogue</i> just given, and
added several notes of his own on the margin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'>[4to. pp. 64, not numbered.]</p>

<p>Of Sir Thomas Overbury's life, and unhappy end, we have so full an account
in the <i>Biographia</i>, and the various historical productions, treating of
the period in which he lived, that nothing further will be expected in
this place. His <i>Wife</i> and <i>Characters</i> were printed, says Wood, several
times during his life, and the edition above noticed, was supposed, by the
Oxford biographer, to be the fourth or fifth<a name="FNanchor_CO_191" id="FNanchor_CO_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_CO_191" class="fnanchor">[CO]</a>. Having never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span> seen a
copy of the early editions, I am unable to fix on any character
undoubtedly the production of Overbury, and the printer confesses some of
them were written by "other learned gentlemen." These were greatly
encreased in subsequent impressions, that of 1614 having only twenty-one
characters, and that in 1622 containing no less than eighty.</p>


<p class='center'>A COURTIER,&mdash;(<i>Sign. C. 4. b.</i>)</p>

<p>To all men's thinking is a man, and to most men the finest: all things
else are defined by the understanding, but this by the sences; but his
surest marke is, that hee is to bee found onely about princes. Hee smells;
and putteth away much of his judgement about the scituation of his
clothes. Hee knowes no man that is not generally knowne. His wit, like the
marigold, openeth with the sunne, and therefore he riseth not before ten
of the clocke. Hee puts more confidence in his words than meaning, and
more in his pronuntiation than his words. Occasion is his Cupid, and hee
hath but one receipt of making loue. Hee followes nothing but
inconstancie, admires nothing but beauty, honours nothing but fortune.
Loues nothing. The sustenance of his discourse his newes, and his censure
like a shot depends vpon the charging. Hee is not, if he be out of court,
but, fish-like, breathes destruction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span> if out of his owne element. Neither
his motion, or aspect are regular, but he mooues by the vpper spheres, and
is the reflexion of higher substances. If you finde him not heere, you
shall in Paules with a pick-tooth in his hat, a cape cloke, and a long
stocking.</p>

<p>In a subsequent impression of this volume, 8vo. in the same year, and with
a fresh title page, dated 1631<a name="FNanchor_CP_192" id="FNanchor_CP_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_CP_192" class="fnanchor">[CP]</a>, we find the author to be "John
Stephens the younger, of Lincoln's Inn:" no other particulars of him
appear to exist at present, excepting that he was the author of a play
entitled, <i>Cinthia's Revenge; or, M&aelig;nander's Extasie</i>. Lond. for Barnes,
1613, 4to. "which," says Langbaine, "is one of the longest plays I ever
read, and withal the most tedious." Ben Jonson addressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span> some lines<a name="FNanchor_CQ_193" id="FNanchor_CQ_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_CQ_193" class="fnanchor">[CQ]</a>
to the author, whom he calls "his much and worthily esteemed friend," as
did F. C. G. Rogers, and Thomas Danet.</p>

<p>Stephens dedicates his book to Thomas Turner, Esq. For the sake of a
little variety I give one of his "three satyricall Essayes on

<p>The author of these characters<a name="FNanchor_CS_195" id="FNanchor_CS_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_CS_195" class="fnanchor">[CS]</a> was Nicholas Breton, who dedicates them

Captain Breton, of Tamworth, in Staffordshire, and served himself in the
Low Countries, under the command of the Earl of Leicester. He married
Anne, daughter of Sir Edward Legh, or Leigh, of Rushell, Staffordshire, by
whom he had five sons and four daughters, and having purchased the manor

<p>Breton appears to have been a poet of considerable reputation among his
contemporaries, as he is noticed with commendation by Puttenhem and Meres:
Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges declares that his poetical powers were
distinguished by a simplicity, at once easy and elegant. Specimens of his
productions in verse, may be found in Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, Ellis's
<i>Specimens</i>, Cooper's <i>Muses' Library, Censura Literaria</i>; and an
imperfect list of his publications is given by Ritson, in the

<p class='center'>A WORTHIE PRIUIE COUNCELLER.</p>


<p>A worthy priuie counceller is the pillar of a realme, in whose wisedome
and care, vnder God and the king, stands the safety of a kingdome; he is
the watch-towre to giue warning of the enemy, and a hand of prouision for
the preseruation of the state: hee is an oracle in the king's eare, and a
sword in the king's hand, an euen weight in the ballance of justice, and a
light of grace in the loue of truth: he is an eye of care in the course of
lawe, a heart of loue in the seruice of his soueraigne, a mind of honour
in the order of his seruice, and a braine of inuention for the good of the
common-wealth; his place is powerful, while his seruice is faithfull, and
his honour due in the desert of his employment. In summe, he is as a fixed
planet mong the starres of the firmament, which through the clouds in the
ayre, shewes the nature of his light.</p>


<p class='center'>AN VNWORTHIE COUNCELLER.</p>


<p>An vnworthie counceller is the hurt of a king, and the danger of a state,
when the weaknes of judgement may commit an error, or the lacke of care
may give way to vnhappinesse:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span> he is a wicked charme in the king's eare, a
sword of terror in the aduice of tyranny: his power is perillous in the
partiality of will, and his heart full of hollownesse in the protestation
of loue: hypocrisie is the couer of his counterfaite religion, and
traiterous inu&#275;tion is the agent of his ambition: he is the cloud of
darknesse, that threatneth foule weather, and if it growe to a storme, it
is feareful where it falls: hee is an enemy to God in the hate of grace,
and worthie of death in disloyalty to his soueraigne. In summe, he is an
vnfit person for the place of a counceller, and an vnworthy subject to
looke a king in the face.</p>


<p class='center'>AN EFFEMINATE FOOL.</p>

<p>An effeminate foole is the figure of a baby: he loues nothing but gay, to
look in a glasse, to keepe among wenches, and to play with trifles; to
feed on sweet meats, and to be daunced in laps, to be inbraced in armes,
and to be kissed on the cheeke: to talke idlely, to looke demurely, to goe
nicely, and to laugh continually: to be his mistresse' servant, and her
mayd's master, his father's love, and his mother's none-child: to play on
a fiddle, and sing a loue-song, to weare sweet gloues, and look on fine
things: to make purposes and write verses, deuise riddles, and tell lies:
to follow plaies, and study daunces, to heare newes, and buy trifles: to
sigh for loue, and weepe for kindnesse, and mourne for company, and bee
sicke for fashion: to ride in a coach, and gallop a hackney, to watch all
night, and sleepe out the morning: to lie on a bed, and take tobacco, and
to send his page of an idle message to his mistresse; to go vpon gigges, to
haue his ruffes set in print, to picke his teeth, and play with a puppet.
In summe, hee is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span> a man-childe, and a woman's man, a gaze of folly, and
wisedome's griefe<a name="FNanchor_CW_199" id="FNanchor_CW_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_CW_199" class="fnanchor">[CW]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Printed at London for Mathew Walbancke and are to be solde at his shops
at the new and old Gate of Grayes-Inne.</i> 1618.</p>

<p class='center'>[4to. pp. 48. title, dedication, &amp;c. eight more.]</p>

<p>A second edition appeared in 1638, and, as the title informs us, "with
some new additions:" what these were I am not able to state, as my copy,
although it appears perfect, contains precisely the same with that of
1618.</p>

<p>Of Geffray Mynshul, as he signs his name to the dedication,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> I can learn
no particulars, but I have reason to suppose him descended from an ancient
and highly respectable family, residing at Minshull, in the county of
Chester<a name="FNanchor_CY_201" id="FNanchor_CY_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_CY_201" class="fnanchor">[CY]</a>, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By what
mishap he became an inmate of the King's-bench prison, from when he
dates<a name="FNanchor_CZ_202" id="FNanchor_CZ_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_CZ_202" class="fnanchor">[CZ]</a> his <i>Essayes</i>, it is impossible to conjecture, but as he talks
of usury and extortion, as well as of severe creditors; and advises those
who are compelled to borrow, to pay as soon as they can, we may suppose
that imprudence and extravagance assisted in reducing him to the situation
he attempts to describe.</p>

<p>In the dedication to his uncle, "Mr. Matthew Mainwaring<a name="FNanchor_DA_203" id="FNanchor_DA_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_DA_203" class="fnanchor">[DA]</a>, of Namptwich,
in Cheshire," he says:&mdash;"Since my comming into this prison, what with the
strangenesse of the place, and strictnesse of my liberty, I am so
transported that I could not follow that study wherein I tooke great
delight and cheife pleasure, and to spend my time idley would but adde
more discontentments to my troubled brest, and being in this chaos of
discontentments, fantasies must arise, which will bring forth the fruits
of an idle braine, for <i>e malis minimum</i>. It is farre better to giue some
accompt of time, though to little purpose,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> than none at all. To which end
I gathered a handfull of essayes, and few characters of such things as by
my owne experience I could say <i>Probatum est</i>: not that thereby I should
either please the reader, or shew exquisitenes of inuention, or curious
stile; seeing what I write of is but the child of sorrow, bred by
discontentments, and nourisht vp with misfortunes, to <a href="#ADDITIONAL_NOTES_AND_CORRECTIONS">whosc</a> help
melancholly Saturne gaue his iudgement, the night-bird her inuention, and
the ominous rauen brought a quill taken from his owne wing, dipt in the
inke of misery, as chiefe ayders in this architect of sorrow."</p>


<p class='center'>"CHARACTER OF A PRISONER.</p>

<p>A prisoner is an impatient patient, lingring vnder the rough hands of a
cruell phisitian: his creditor hauing cast his water knowes his disease,
and hath power to cure him, but takes more pleasure to kill him. He is
like Tantalus, who hath freedome running by his doore, yet cannot enioy
the least benefit thereof. His greatest griefe is that his credit was so
good and now no better. His land is drawne within the compasse of a
sheepe's skin, and his owne hand the fortification that barres him of
entrance: hee is fortunes tossing-bal, an obiect that would make mirth
melancholy: to his friends an abiect, and a subiect of nine dayes' wonder
in euery barber's shop, and a mouthfull of pitty (that he had no better
fortune) to midwiues and talkatiue gossips; and all the content that this
transitory life can giue him seemes but to flout him, in respect the
restraint of liberty barres the true vse. To his familiars hee is like a
plague, whom they dare scarce come nigh for feare of infection, he is a
monument ruined by those which raysed him, he spends the day with a <i>hei
mihi! ve miserum</i>! and the night with a <i>nullis est medicabilis herbis</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>I have little doubt but that the initials H. P. may be attributed with

<p>It appears from the Preface to <i>Cvres for the Itch</i>, that the <i>Epigrams
and Epitaphs</i> were written in 1624, during the author's residence in the
country, at the "<i>long vacation</i>," and the <i>Characters</i><a name="FNanchor_DE_207" id="FNanchor_DE_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_DE_207" class="fnanchor">[DE]</a>, which are
"not so fully perfected as was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span> meant," were composed "of later times."
The following afford as fair a specimen of this part of the volume as can
be produced.</p>


<p class='center'>"A SCOLD. (B. 5.)</p>

<p>Is a much more heard of, then least desired to bee seene or knowne,
she-kinde of serpent; the venom'd sting of whose poysonous tongue, worse
then the biting of a scorpion, proues more infectious farre then can be
cured. Shee's of all other creatures most vntameablest, and couets more
the last word in scoulding, then doth a Combater the last stroke for
victorie. She lowdest lifts it standing at her door, bidding, w<sup>th</sup>
exclamation, flat defiance to any one sayes blacke's her eye. She dares
appeare before any iustice, nor is least daunted with the sight of
counstable, nor at worst threatnings of a cucking-stoole. There's nothing
mads or moues her more to outrage, then but the very naming of a wispe, or
if you sing or whistle when she is scoulding. If any in the interim chance
to come within her reach, twenty to one she scratcheth him by the face; or
doe but offer to hold her hands, sheel presently begin to cry out murder.
There's nothing pacifies her but a cup of sacke, which taking in full
measure of digestion, shee presently forgets all wrongs that's done her,
and thereupon falls streight a weeping. Doe but intreat her with faire
words, or flatter her, she then confesseth all her imperfections, and
layes the guilt vpon the whore her mayd. Her manner is to talke much in
her sleepe, what wrongs she hath indured of that rogue her husband whose
hap may be in time to dye a martyr; and so I leaue them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>


<p class='center'>"A GOOD WIFE,</p>

<p>Is a world of happiness, that brings with it a kingdom in conceit, and
makes a perfect adiunct in societie; shee's such a comfort as exceeds
content, and proues so precious as canot be paralleld, yea more
inestimable then may be valued. Shee's any good man's better second selfe,
the very mirror of true constant modesty, the carefull huswife of
frugalitie, and dearest obiect of man's heart's felicitie. She commands
with mildnesse, rules with discretion, liues in repute, and ordereth all
things that are good or necessarie. Shee's her husband's solace, her
house's ornament, her children's succor, and her seruant's comfort. Shee's
(to be briefe) the eye of warinesse, the tongue of silence, the hand of
labour, and the heart of loue. Her voice is musicke, her countenance
meeknesse; her minde vertuous, and her soule gratious. Shee's a blessing
giuen from God to man, a sweet companion in his affliction, and ioynt
co-partner upon all occasions. Shee's (to conclude) earth's chiefest
paragon, and will bee, when shee dyes, heauen's dearest creature."</p>

Michael Sparke, dwelling at the blue Bible, in Greene Arbor. 1629.</i></p>

<p class='center'>[8vo. containing 56 pages, not numbered.]</p>

<p>The characters in this volume are "A fantasticke taylor; a player; a
shooe-maker; a rope-maker; a smith; a tobacconist; a cunning woman; a

Bethlem; Ludgate; Bridewell; (and) Newgate."&mdash;</p>


<p class='center'>"A PLAYER.&mdash;(<i>Sign. B.</i> iii.)</p>

<p>Is a volume of various conceits or epitome of time, who by his
representation and appearance makes things long past seeme present. He is
much like the compters in arithmeticke, and may stand one while for a
king, another while a begger,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span> many times as a mute or cypher. Sometimes
hee represents that which in his life he scarse practises&mdash;to be an honest
man. To the point, hee oft personates a rover, and therein comes neerest
to himselfe. If his action prefigure passion, he raues, rages, and
protests much by his painted heauens, and seemes in the heighth of this
fit ready to pull Ioue out of the garret, where pershance hee lies leaning
on his elbowes, or is imployed to make squips and crackers to grace the
play. His audience are often-times iudicious, but his chiefe admirers are
commonly young wanton chamber-maids, who are so taken with his posture and
gay clothes, they neuer come to be their owne women after. Hee exasperates
men's enormities in publike view, and tels them their faults on the stage,
not as being sorry for them, but rather wishes still hee might finde more
occasions to worke on. He is the generall corrupter of spirits, yet
vntainted, inducing them by gradation to much lasciuious deprauity. He is
a perspicuity of vanity in variety, and suggests youth to perpetrate such
vices, as otherwise they had haply nere heard of. He is (for the most
part) a notable hypocrite, seeming what he is not, and is indeed what hee
seemes not. And if hee lose one of his fellow stroules, in the summer he
turnes king of the gipsies: if not, some great man's protection is a
sufficient warrant for his peregrination, and a meanes to procure him the
town-hall, where hee may long exercise his qualities, with clown-claps of
great admiration, in a tone sutable to the large eares of his illiterate
auditorie. Hee is one seldome takes care for old age, because ill diet and
disorder, together with a consumption, or some worse disease, taken vp in
his full careere, haue onely chalked out his catastrophe but to a colon:
and he scarsely suruiues to his naturall period of dayes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'>"A CORRANTO-COINER&mdash;(p. 15.)</p>

<p>Is a state newes-monger; and his owne genius is his intelligencer. His
mint goes weekely, and he coines monie by it. Howsoeuer, the more
intelligent merchants doe jeere him, the vulgar doe admire him, holding
his novels oracular: and these are usually sent for tokens or intermissiue
curtsies betwixt city and countrey. Hee holds most constantly one forme or
method of discourse. He retaines some militarie words of art, which hee
shootes at randome; no matter where they hitt, they cannot wound any. He
ever leaves some passages doubtfull, as if they were some more intimate
secrecies of state, clozing his sentence abruptly with&mdash;<i>heereafter you
shall heare more</i>. Which words, I conceive, he onely useth as baites, to
make the appetite of the reader more eager in his next week's pursuit for
a more satisfying labour. Some generall-erring relations he pickes up, as
crummes or fragments, from a frequented ordinarie: of which shreads he
shapes a cote to fit any credulous foole that will weare it. You shall
never observe him make any reply in places of publike concourse; hee
ingenuously acknowledges himselfe to bee more bounden to the happinesse of
a retentive memory, than eyther ability of tongue, or pregnancy of
conceite. He carryes his table-booke still about with him, but dares not
pull it out publikely. Yet no sooner is the table drawne, than he turnes
notarie; by which meanes hee recovers the charge of his ordinarie. Paules
is his walke in winter; Moorfields<a name="FNanchor_DJ_212" id="FNanchor_DJ_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_DJ_212" class="fnanchor">[DJ]</a> in sommer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> Where the whole
discipline, designes, projects, and exploits of the States, Netherlands,
Poland, Switzer, Crimchan and all, are within the compasse of one
quadrangle walke most judiciously and punctually discovered. But long he
must not walke, lest hee make his newes-presse stand. Thanks to his good
invention, he can collect much out of a very little: no matter though more
experienced judgements disprove him; hee is anonymos, and that wil secure
him. To make his reports more credible or, (which he and his stationer
onely aymes at,) more vendible, in the relation of every occurrent he
renders you the day of the moneth; and to approve himselfe a scholler, he
annexeth these Latine parcells, or parcell-gilt sentences, <i>veteri stylo,
novo stylo</i>. Palisados, parapets, counterscarfes, forts, fortresses,
rampiers, bulwarks, are his usual dialect. Hee writes as if he would doe
some mischiefe, yet the charge of his shot is but paper. Hee will
sometimes start in his sleepe, as one affrighted with visions, which I can
impute to no other cause but to the terrible skirmishes which he
discoursed of in the day-time. He has now tyed himselfe apprentice to the
trade of minting, and must weekly performe his taske, or (beside the losse
which accrues to himselfe,) he disappoints a number of no small fooles,
whose discourse, discipline, and discretion, is drilled from his
state-service. These you shall know by their Mondai's morning question, a
little before Exchange time; <i>Stationer, have you any newes?</i> Which they
no sooner purchase than peruse; and, early by next morning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span> (lest their
countrey friend should be deprived of the benefit of so rich a prize,)
they freely vent the substance of it, with some illustrations, if their
understanding can furnish them that way. He would make you beleeve that
hee were knowne to some forraine intelligence, but I hold him the wisest
man that hath the least faith to beleeve him. For his relations he stands
resolute, whether they become approved, or evinced for untruths; which if
they bee, hee has contracted with his face never to blush for the matter.
Hee holds especiall concurrence with two philosophicall sects, though hee
bee ignorant of the tenets of either: in the collection of his
observations, he is <i>peripateticall</i>, for hee walkes circularly; in the
digestion of his relations he is <i>Stoicall</i>, and sits regularly. Hee has
an alphabeticall table of all the chiefe commanders, generals, leaders,
provinciall townes, rivers, ports, creekes, with other fitting materials
to furnish his imaginary building. Whisperings, muttrings, and bare
suppositions, are sufficient grounds for the authoritie of his relations.
It is strange to see with what greedinesse this ayrie Chameleon, being all
lungs and winde, will swallow a receite of newes, as if it were physicall:
yea, with what frontlesse insinuation he will scrue himselfe into the
acquaintance of some knowing <i>Intelligencers</i>, who, trying the cask by his
hollow sound, do familiarly gull him. I am of opinion, were all his
voluminous centuries of fabulous relations compiled, they would vye in
number with the Iliads of many forerunning ages. You shall many times
finde in his Gazettas, pasquils, and corrantos miserable distractions;
here a city taken by force long before it bee besieged; there a countrey
laid waste before ever the enemie entered. He many times tortures his
readers with impertinencies, yet are these the tolerablest passages
throughout all his discourse. He is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span> the very landskip of our age. He is
all ayre; his eare alwayes open to all reports, which, how incredible
soever, must passe for currant, and find vent, purposely to get him
currant money, and delude the vulgar. Yet our best comfort is, his
chymeras live not long; a weeke is the longest in the citie, and after
their arrival, little longer in the countrey; which past, they melt like
<i>Butter</i>, or match a pipe, and so <i>Burne</i><a name="FNanchor_DK_213" id="FNanchor_DK_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_DK_213" class="fnanchor">[DK]</a>. But indeede, most commonly
it is the height of their ambition to aspire to the imployment of stopping
mustard-pots, or wrapping up pepper, pouder, staves-aker, &amp;c. which done,
they expire. Now for his habit, Wapping and Long-lane will give him his
character. Hee honours nothing with a more indeered observance, nor hugges
ought with more intimacie than antiquitie, which he expresseth even in his
cloathes. I have knowne some love fish best that smelled of the panyer;
and the like humour reignes in him, for hee loves that apparele best that
has a taste of the broker. Some have held him for a scholler, but trust
mee such are in a palpable errour, for hee never yet understood so much
Latine as to construe <i>Gallo-Belgicus</i>. For his librarie (his owne
continuations excepted,) it consists of very few or no bookes. He holds
himselfe highly engaged to his invention if it can purchase him victuals;
for authors hee never converseth with them, unlesse they walke in Paules.
For his discourse it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span> ordinarie, yet hee will make you a terrible
repetition of desperate commanders, unheard of exployts; intermixing
withall his owne personall service. But this is not in all companies, for
his experience hath sufficiently informed him in this principle&mdash;that as
nothing workes more on the simple than things strange and incredibly rare;
so nothing discovers his weaknesse more among the knowing and judicious
than to insist, by way of discourse, on reports above conceite. Amongst
these, therefore, hee is as mute as a fish. But now imagine his lampe (if
he be worth one,) to be neerely burnt out; his inventing genius wearied
and surfoote with raunging over so many unknowne regions; and himselfe,
wasted with the fruitlesse expence of much paper, resigning his place of
weekly collections to another, whom, in hope of some little share, hee has
to his stationer recommended, while he lives either poorely respected, or
dyes miserably suspended. The rest I end with his owne cloze:&mdash;<i>Next weeke
you shall heare more</i>."</p>

copy of this rare volume is in the possession of Mr. Douce, who, with his
accustomed liberality, permitted my able and excellent friend, Mr. John
James Park, to draw up the following account of it for the present volume.</p>

<p>To "The Epistle dedicatory" of this impression, the initials (or such
like) of dedicatee's name only are given, for, says the dedicator, "I know
no fame can redound unto you by these meane essayes, which were written,

their oaten pipes, to recreate themselves, not to get credit."</p>

<p>"To the Reader.&mdash;Since the title is the first leafe that cometh under
censure, some, perhaps, will dislike the name of pictures, and say, I have
no <i>colour</i> for it, which I confesse, for these pictures are not drawne in
colours, but in characters, representing to the eye of the minde divers
severall professions, which, if they appeare more obscure than I coulde
wish, yet I would have you know that it is not the nature of a character,
to be as smooth as a bull-rush, but to have some fast and loose knots,
which the ingenious reader may easily untie. The first picture is the
description of a maide, which young men may read, and from thence learn to
know, that vertue is the truest beauty. The next follow in their order,
being set together in this <i>little</i> book, that in winter you may reade
them <i>ad ignem</i>, by the fire-side, and in summer <i>ad umbram</i>, under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span> some
shadie tree, and therewith passe away the tedious howres. So hoping of thy
favourable censure, knowing that the least judicious are most ready to
judge, I expose them to thy view, with Apelles motto, <i>Ne sutor, ultra

bids you welcome.</p>

<p class='center'>"THE TEARME</p>

<p>Is a time when Justice keeps open court for all commers, while her sister
Equity strives to mitigate the rigour of her positive sentence. It is
called the Tearme, because it does end and terminate busines, or else
because it is the <i>Terminus</i> ad quem, that is, the end of the countrey
man's journey, who comes up to the Tearme, and with his hobnayle shooes
grindes the faces of the poore stones, and so returnes againe. It is the
soule of the yeare, and makes it quicke, which before was dead. Inkeepers
gape for it as earnestly as shelfish doe for salt water after a low ebbe.
It sends forth new bookes into the world, and replenishes Paul's walke
with fresh company, where <i>Quid novi?</i> is their first salutation, and the
weekely newes their chiefe discourse. The tavernes are painted against the
tearme, and many a cause is argu'd there and try'd at that barre, where
you are adjudg'd to pay the costs and charges, and so dismist with
'welcome gentlemen.' Now the citty puts her best side outward, and a new
play at the Blackfryers is attended on with coaches. It keepes watermen
from sinking and helpes them with many a fare voyage to Westminster. Your
choyse beauties come up to it onely to see and be seene, and to learne the
newest fashion, and for some other recreations. Now monie that has beene
long sicke and crasie, begins to stirre and walke abroad, especially if
some young prodigalls come to towne, who bring more money than wit.
Lastly, the tearme is the joy of the citty, a deare friend to countrymen,
and is never more welcome than after a long vacation."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'>"THE HORSE (No. 16.)</p>

<p>Is a creature made, as it were, in waxe. When Nature first framed him, she
took a secret complacence in her worke. He is even her master-peece in
irracionall things, borrowing somewhat of all things to set him forth. For
example, his slicke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span> bay coat hee tooke from the chesnut; his necke from
the rainbow, which perhaps make him rain so wel. His maine belike he took
from <i>Pegasus</i>, making him a hobbie to make this a compleat gennet<a name="FNanchor_DN_216" id="FNanchor_DN_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_DN_216" class="fnanchor">[DN]</a>,
which main he weares so curld, much after the women's fashions now adayes;
this I am sure of howsoever, it becomes them, [and] it sets forth our
gennet well. His legges he borrowed of the hart, with his swiftnesse,
which makes him a true courser indeed. The starres in his forehead hee
fetcht from heaven, which will not be much mist, there being so many. The
little head he hath, broad breast, fat buttocke, and thicke tayle are
properly his owne, for he knew not where to get him better. If you tell
him of the hornes he wants to make him most compleat, he scornes the
motion, and sets them at his heele. He is well shod especially in the
upper leather, for as for his soles, they are much at reparation, and
often faine to be removed. Nature seems to have spent an apprentiship of
yeares to make you such a one, for it is full seven yeares ere hee comes
to this perfection, and be fit for the saddle: for then (as we,) it seemes
to come to the yeares of discretion, when he will shew a kinde of
rationall judgement with him, and if you set an expert rider on his backe,
you shall see how sensiblie they will talke together, as master and

will play the countrey gentleman as truly, as before the knight in
turnament. If the game be up once, and the hounds in chase, you shall see
how he will pricke up his eares streight, and tickle at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span> sport as much
as his rider shall, and laugh so loud, that if there be many of them, they
will even drowne the rurall harmony of the dogges. When he travels, of all
innes he loves best the signe of the silver bell, because likely there he
fares best, especially if hee come the first, and get the prize. He
carries his eares upright, nor seldome ever lets them fall till they be
cropt off, and after that, as in despight, will never weare them more. His
taile is so essentiall to him, that if he loose it once hee is no longer
an horse, but ever stiled a curtall. To conclude, he is a blade of
Vulcan's forging, made for Mars of the best metall, and the post of Fame
to carrie her tidings through the world, who, if he knew his own strength,
would shrewdly put for the monarchie of our wildernesse."</p>

Sir John Hawkins, in his <i>History of Musick</i>, iv. 391. says that it occurs
in the opera of <i>Dioclesian</i>, set to music by Purcell, and explains it to
be "a very sprightly movement of two reprises, or strains, with eight bars
in each: the time three quarters in a bar, the first pointed." I take this
opportunity of mentioning, that among Dr. Rawlinson's MSS. in the
Bodleian, [<i>Poet.</i> 108.] is a volume which contains a variety of figures
of old dances, written, as I conjecture, between the years 1566 and 1580.
Besides several others are the <i>pavyan</i>; <i>my Lord of Essex measures</i>;
<i>tyntermell</i>; <i>the old allmayne</i>; <i>the longe pavian</i>; <i>quanto dyspayne</i>;
<i>the nyne muses</i>, &amp;c. As the pavian is mentioned by Shakspeare, in the
<i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, and as the directions for dancing the figure
have not been before discovered, I shall make no apology for offering them
in the present note.

<p>I dare affirme him a Jew by descent, and of the tribe of Benjamin,
lineally descended from the first King of the Jewes, even Saul, or at best
he ownes him and his tribe, in most we reade of them. First, of our
English tribes, I conceive his father's the lowest, and the meanest of
that tribe, stocke, or generation, and the worst, how bad soever they be;
melancholy he is, as appeares by his sullen and dogged wit; malicious as
Saul to David, as is evident in his writings; he wants but Saul's javelin
to cast at him; he as little spares the king's friends with his pen, as
Saul did Jonathan his sonne in his reproach; and would be as free of his
javelin as his pen, were his power sutable to his will, as Ziba did to
Mephibosheth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> so does he by the king, he belies him as much to the world,
as he his master to David, and in the day of adversitie is as free of his
tongue as Shimei was to his soveraigne, and would be as humble as he, and
as forward to meet the king as he was David, should the king returne in
peace. Abithaes there cannot want to cut off the dog's head, but David is
more mercifull then Shimei can be wicked; may he first consult with the
witch of Endor, but not worthy of so noble a death as his own sword, die
the death of Achitophel for feare of David, then may he be hang'd up as
the sonnes of Saul were against the sunne, or rather as the Amelekites who
slew Isbosheth, and brought tidings and the tokens of the treason to
David; may his hands and his feet be as sacrifices cut off, and so pay for
the treasons of his pen and tongue; may all heads that plot treasons, all
tongues that speake them, all pens that write them, be so punisht. If
Sheba paid his head for his tongue's fault, what deserves Britannicus to
pay for his pen and trumpet? Is there never a wise woman in London? we
have Abishaes.</p>

<p>Francis Wortley, was the son of Sir Richard Wortley, of Wortley, in
Yorkshire, knight. At the age of seventeen he became a commoner of
Magdalen College, Oxford; in 1610 he was knighted, and on the 29th of June
in the following year, was created a baronet; being then, as Wood says,
esteemed an ingenious gentleman. During the civil wars he assisted the
royal cause, by raising a troop of horse in the king's service; but at
their conclusion he was taken prisoner, and confined in the tower of
London, where it seems he composed the volume just noticed. In the
<i>Catalogue of Compounders</i> his name appears as "of Carleton, Yorkshire,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and from thence we learn that he paid 500<i>l.</i> for his remaining property.
In the <i>Athen&aelig; Oxonienses</i> may be found a list of his works, but I have
been unable to trace the date of his decease. Mr. Granger says that "Anne,
his daughter, married the second son of the first Earl of Sandwich, who
took the name of Wortley," and adds that the late Countess of Bute was
descended from him. <i>Biographical History</i>, ii. 310.</p>

The ecchoes, whereby what is done in part of the kingdome, is heard all

<p>Richard Flecknoe, the author of these characters, is more known from
having his name affixed to one of the severest satires ever written by
Dryden, than from any excellence of his own as a poet or dramatic writer.
Mr. Reed conceives him to have been a Jesuit, and Pope terms him an Irish
priest. Langbaine says, that "his acquaintance with the nobility was more
than with the muses, and he had a greater propensity to rhyming, than a
genius to poetry." As a proof of the former assertion the Duke of
Newcastle prefixed two copies of verses to his characters, in which he
calls Flecknoe "his worthy friend," and says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Flecknoe, thy characters are so full of wit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fancy, as each word is throng'd with it.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whole libraries were in each character.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor arrows in a quiver stuck, nor yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lights in the starry skies are thicker set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor quills upon the armed porcupine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than wit and fancy in this work of thine.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p class='right'>W. Newcastle."</p>

<p>To confirm the latter, requires only the perusal of his verses, which were
published in 1653, under the title of <i>Miscellania</i>. Besides these, he
wrote five<a name="FNanchor_DV_224" id="FNanchor_DV_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_DV_224" class="fnanchor">[DV]</a> dramatic pieces, the titles of which may be found in the
<i>Biographia Dramatica</i>; a collection of <i>Epigrams</i>, 8vo. 1670; <i>Ten Years

<p>"He is onely a man; your coward and rash being but tame and savage beasts.
His courage is still the same, and drink cannot make him more valiant, nor
danger lesse. His valour is enough to leaven whole armies, he is an army
himself worth an army of other men. His sword is not alwayes out like
children's daggers, but he is alwayes last in beginning quarrels, though
first in ending them. He holds honour (though delicate as chrystall) yet
not so slight and brittle to be broak and crackt with every touch;
therefore (though most wary of it,) is not querilous nor punctilious. He
is never troubled with passion, as knowing no degree beyond clear courage,
and is alwayes valiant, but never furious. He is the more gentle i' th'
chamber, more fierce he's in the field, holding boast (the coward's
valour,) and cruelty (the beast's,) unworthy a valiant man. He is only
coward in this, that he dares not do an unhandsome action. In fine, he can

<p>Page <a href="#Page_4">4</a>, line 9, "<i>table-book.</i>" The custom of writing in
table-books, or, as it was then expressed, "in tables," is
noticed, and instances given in Reed's <i>Shakspeare</i>, vi, 13.
xii, 170. xviii, 88. Dr. Farmer adduces a passage very
applicable to the text, from Hall's character of the
<i>hypocrite</i>. "He will ever sit where he may be seene best,
and in the midst of the sermon pulles out his <i>tables</i> in
haste, as if he feared to loose that note," &amp;c. Decker, in
his <i>Guls Hornebooke</i>, page 8, speaking to his readers,
says, "out with your <i>tables</i>," &amp;c.
</p>


<p>Page <a href="#Page_6">6</a>, note 6.&mdash;This is also mentioned in <i>Whimzies</i>, 8vo. 1631,
p. 57. "Hee must now betake himself to prayer and devotion;

that famous foundation</i>: all which he performes with as much
zeale as an actor after the end of a play, when hee prayes
for his majestie, the lords of his most honourable privie
councell, and all that love the king."</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_13">13</a>, note 10.&mdash;From a subsequent edition, obligingly pointed
out to me by the rev. Mr. arch-deacon Nares, I find that
this also is a translation: <i>Regimen Sanitatis Salerni. This

<p>Page <a href="#Page_17">17</a>, line 17, "<i>door-posts</i>."&mdash;It was usual for public
officers to have painted or gilded posts at their doors, on
which proclamations, and other documents of that
description, were placed, in order to be read by the
populace. See various allusions to this custom, in Reed's
<i>Shakspeare</i>, v. 267. <i>Old Plays</i>, iii. 303. The
<i>reformation</i> means that they were, in the language of our
modern churchwardens, "repaired and beautified," during the
reign of our alderman.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_47">47</a>, line 15. "<i>post and pair</i>" was a game at cards, of which
I can give no description. The author of the <i>Compleat
Gamester</i> notices it as "very much played in the West of
England." See Dodsley's <i>Old Plays</i>, 1780. vii. 296.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_48">48</a>, line 12&mdash;"<i>guarded with more gold lace</i>." The word
<i>guarded</i> is continually used by the writers of the
sixteenth century for <i>fringed</i> or <i>adorned</i>. See Reed's

<p>Page <a href="#Page_59">59</a>, line 15, "<i>clout</i>." Shakspeare (Cymbeline, act iv. scene

<p>Several errors and inaccuracies of less consequence than those here

<p>The <i>Inscription</i>, No. <a href="#No_X">x</a>. of the <i>Appendix</i>, should have been entirely
omitted. The following extract from Guillim's <i>Heraldry</i>, shews that
Bishop Earle could not have been connected with the Streglethorp family,
since, if he had, there would have been no occasion for a new grant of
armorial bearings.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He beareth <i>ermine</i>, on a chief indented sable, three
eastern crowns or, by the name of <i>Earles</i>. This coat was
granted by <i>Sir Edward Walker</i>, garter, the 1st of August,
1660, to the Reverend Dr. <i>John Earles</i>, son of <i>Thomas
Earles</i>, gent, sometime Register of the Archbishop's Court
at York. He was Dean of <i>Westminster</i>, and Clerk of the
Closet to his Majesty King <i>Charles</i> the Second; and in the
year 1663, made Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i>."</p>

<p>Guillim's <i>Heraldry</i>, folio. Lond. 1724. p. 282.</p>

<p>It is almost unnecessary to add that I was not aware of this grant, when I
compiled the short account of Earle, at page <a href="#Page_186">186</a>, and spoke of my
inability to give any information relative to his parents.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p></div>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SUPPLEMENTARY_APPENDIX" id="SUPPLEMENTARY_APPENDIX"></a>SUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIX.</h2>

<p>VARIOUS READINGS AND VERSIONS FROM THE DURHAM MS.</p>


<p class='center'>A CHILDE.</p>

<p>1. "His soul is yet a white <i>page</i>" (paper).</p>


<p class='center'>AN ORDINARY PHYSITIAN.</p>

<p>4. After the words "take Physicke." "He drives away ye time if he cannot
ye maladie, and is furnished with an hundred merrie tales for the purpose.
He is no faithful friend for he leaves a man gasping, and his pretence is,
death and he are enemies."</p>


<p class='center'>A SELFE-CONCEITED MAN.</p>

<p>10 (<i>11 in Bliss</i>). "A parasite is a stale to him," for "<i>a flatterer is a
dunce to him</i>."</p>


<p class='center'>A RESERVED MAN.</p>

<p>26 (<i>12 in Bliss</i>). "Never speaks above the audit of a whisper," for
"<i>whispers you in the ear acts</i>."</p>


<p class='center'>A DOUNE-RIGHT SCHOLLER.</p>

<p>20 (<i>21 in Bliss</i>). After "language of a falconer." "He is frigging up and
doune, and composeth not his body to a settled posture. Gallants mock him
for ushering Gentlewomen and indeed he hath not squired it in their
Allies."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>


<p class='center'>A POTT POET.</p>

<p>22 (<i>28 in Bliss</i>). After "patches," "yet their footemanshippe is not
altogether shuffling." After "His other poems are but briefs." "At more
leisur'd times he makes disticks on noblemen which are put under their
twopenny pictures that hang in the bookbinders' shops."</p>


<p class='center'>A FORWARD, BOLD MAN.</p>

<p>30 (<i>43 in Bliss</i>). <i>For</i> "like a desperate soldier," read "like our
north-west merchants, will venture where he cannot goe." Also "Saint
<i>Laurence</i>" <i>for</i> "St. Maries."</p>


<p class='center'>A PLAINE COUNTRIE FELLOWE.</p>

<p>23 (<i>22 in Bliss</i>). After "sallets." "He will talk with his oxen very
soberly and expostulates with his hindes, and then in the same language he
guides the plow, and the plough guides his thoughts, and his bounde or
landmarke is the very limitts of his cogitation."</p>


<p class='center'>A SERGEANT, (SERIEANT).</p>

<p>32 (<i>52 in Bliss</i>). After "Attempted and atchieved," "clubbes out of
charity knocke him doune; next an hereticke he is the worst man to follow
for he leads by the arme to destruction; his most dangerous place is
Chancery Lane's end where he hansells now and then."</p>


<p class='center'>A PARTIALL MAN.</p>

<p>33 (<i>37 in Bliss</i>). After "colledge." "The Puritane is most guilty of this
humour, for he takes the opinion of one Dutch commentatour before a legion
of fathers; and, which is worse, his own before them both."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>


<p class='center'>A TRUMPETTER.</p>

<p>34 (<i>38 in Bliss</i>). "In short he is a bubble <i>and his life a blast</i>."</p>


<p class='center'>A PAULES WALKE.</p>

<p>43 (<i>41 in Bliss</i>). "Properest," for "<i>perfectest</i> motion." After
"a-foot." "It hath its tempests like the sea, and as violent, and men are
ship-wrack't upon pillars like great rocks." And <i>at the end</i> after "could
not"&mdash;"ffinally it is used for a church of these two only, sharkes and cut
purses, the one comes thither to fast, the other to prey."</p>


<p class='center'>A DUN.</p>

<p>42 (<i>53 in Bliss</i>). After "shift in the world," comes "He is like a
frivlous suitor, <i>haunting</i>, <i>haunting</i> (sic) those ..." (in place of the
sentence in Bliss beginning "some chuse," which is transposed in MS. with
very slight changes so as to follow the sentence ending with "find them
within.")</p>


<p class='center'>A PLAUSIBLE MAN.</p>

<p>45 (<i>29 in Bliss</i>). "He supples all and discommends none, except where his
commendations might crosse the company, and then he holds his
peace,"&mdash;after the words "what is civil."</p>


<p class='center'>A BAKER.</p>

<p><i>16 in MS.</i> (<i>44 in Bliss</i>). "His condition is the same with all other
men, for he lives by bread which from a rude and undigested heape he putts
into lumpe and forme. His kneading tub and his pavin are the two misteries
of his occupation and he is a filcher by his trade, but the miller is
before him. Thrive he cannot much in the world, for his cake is oft<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span> dow
bak't and will never be a man of valour he is still so meall-mouth'd, he
is observed for a great lyer for he is seldome true in his tale, though
the score be many times on his pate for better reckoning, one vertue he
hath that he is charitable, for his bread is often given to the poore. A
clarke of the market he abhorres, and a pair of weight scales over-throwes
him, yet he finds mercy in his offences, and his basket only is sent to
prison. Many a pillery is his deadly enemie, and they never meete but they
goe together by the eares."</p>

<p><i>The additional matter in the "Bright MS." is found here also.</i></p>


<p class='center'>AN HERAULD.<a name="FNanchor_DZ_228" id="FNanchor_DZ_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_DZ_228" class="fnanchor">[DZ]</a></p>

<p>(<i>Almost identical with the version in the "Bright MS."</i>)</p>

<p><i>40 in MS.</i> (<i>46 in Bliss</i>). "He gives armes himselfe though he be no
Gentleman, and therefore hath good reason to dispence with other; his
trade and profession is honour, and doth that which few noble can doe,
thrive by the Title. You would think he had the Indian mines, for he tells
of the fesse<a name="FNanchor_EA_229" id="FNanchor_EA_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_EA_229" class="fnanchor">[EA]</a> of gold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span> and silver, but believe him not for they are but
devises to get money: he seemes only to deale with Gentry, but his
chiefest purchases are on them that are none, whose bounty he conceales
yet blazons: his bribes are like those of a corrupt judge, for they are
the prizes<a name="FNanchor_EB_230" id="FNanchor_EB_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_EB_230" class="fnanchor">[EB]</a> of blood. His traffiques are like children's gew-gawes,
pendants, and scutchions and little daggars, and his penniworths are
extraordinary deare ffor he holdes three Boares heads higher than three
Brawnes in the market. He was sometime the coate of Mars, but is now for
more mercifull battailes in the tilt yard where whosoever is victorious
the spoyles are his. His is an art in England but nature in Wales, where
they are borne with Herauldry in their mouthes, and each name is a
pedigree."</p>


<p class='center'>A YOUNG RAW PREACHER.</p>

<p>2. "<i>Till ye clocke stop him.</i>" "Little instructions shall you have though
great store of doctrines and many uses to small purpose; he putts much
zeale into his booke, and belabours his tongue exceedingly. The only thing
he makes himselfe in his sermons is faces, his action is all passions, and
his speach interiections. He hath an excellent faculty in crying 'ah!' and
spits with a very good grace." "<i>He will not, etc.</i>" "He cites Pastills
for authors, Perkins for fathers, and some catechisme is his schoole
divinity."</p>


<p class='center'>A GRAVE DIVINE.</p>

<p>3. "Arts his way." "He thinks he ought to become learned to learne so high
a mystery, w<sup>ch</sup> like ye dye of scarlet is not set well upon a raw
cloath, but requires a former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span> tincture."<a name="FNanchor_EC_231" id="FNanchor_EC_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_EC_231" class="fnanchor">[EC]</a> "<i>He accounts, etc.</i>" For
"ballast" read "<i>last blast</i>" (in the first sentence).</p>


<p class='center'>AN ANTIQUARY.</p>

<p><i>9 in MS.</i> (<i>7 in Bliss</i>). "His life was in this age, his conversation
long before, and his acquaintance of some thousand yeares before he was
borne. He is a great enemy to the man of time, and fetches many a morsell
againe out of his stomacke, when it is now all rotten and stinking. Old
women should like him very well for he is much enamoured of wrinckles, and
loves all things, as Dutchmen doe cheese, ye better for being mouldy and
worm-eaten." "<i>He is of our Religion, etc.</i>"</p>


<p class='center'>A PLAYER.</p>

<p><i>19 in MS.</i> (<i>23 in Bliss</i>). "<i>Upon him.</i>" "He hath reason to be
experienced in the world, for he hath passed through more shapes then
Pythagoras his soule, and knows all conditions from y^e King to the
Cobler, he is qualified and hath many good parts, but he is condemned for
one boasting humour, that he will speake them himselfe." "<i>He hath one,
etc.</i>" "<i>Never con'd.</i>" "A true man he can hardly be, for he pleaseth the
better he counterfeits, except only when he is disguised with straw for
gold lace. His comings in are tollerable, yet in small money, and like
Halifax great viccaridge most of it in two pences." "<i>The waisting woman,
etc.</i>" "<i>Gentlemen</i>," "and may become the bench in time as well they. He
neadeth not feare death, for killing is but his sport, and his chiefe
practice hath beene to dye bravely."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>


<p class='center'>A YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN THE UNIVERSITY.</p>

<p><i>18 in MS.</i> (<i>25 in Bliss</i>). "<i>Spend next day.</i>" "If you speake to him as
a Schooler, he telleth you you mistake him he is a gentleman and loath to
marre his stile with that title. Sometime upon intreaty he vouchsafeth to
be a Batchelour, and thinks he hath done the degree great grace in taking
it." "<i>His companion, etc.</i>" Above this, and after the word "misplacing."
"He comes often to his bookes but seldome to his study, unless he be taken

VICCARS (MS.)<br />
SINGING MEN.<br />
</p>

<p><i>6 in MS.</i> (<i>47 in Bliss</i>). "<i>To sing catches.</i>" "In their election of a
brother they are respectfull of his gifts, that is, of his bottles of
sacke, and he that is most liberall to them heere makes them sure. If they
get a church their faces are the richer, and they are men of more
reckoning at the bush or read lattice." "Long lived, etc."</p>


<p class='center'>A SHOP-KEEPER.</p>

<p><i>39 in MS.</i> (<i>48 in Bliss</i>). "He examines the necessity of passengers, and
beggs in the phrase of the giver 'with what do you lacke?'" "... <i>abuse
his brother</i>. His prizes are like new playes, very dear at first view, but
after you goe over them they still fall lower, and he is one who of all
men you shoulde not take of his worde." "<i>He is your slave, etc.</i>"</p>


<p class='center'>A BOWL ALLEY.</p>

<p><i>38 in MS.</i> (<i>30 in Bliss</i>). "Say nothing." "It is their as it is at
skirmishes the first man doth much, and no victory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span> without a good
leader." "<i>It is, etc.</i>" After the first sentence comes in MS. "fortune is
never pox't louder nor the Deuill oftener sent about errands; he is the
companion that goes with every bowle, and with him the bowlers."</p>


<p class='center'>A SHE PRECISE HYPOCRITE.</p>

<p class='center'>(The Shee Puritane <i>in the MS.</i>)</p>

<p><i>36 in MS.</i> (<i>34 in Bliss</i>). "Owne Parish." "And if her husband be so
profaine that he will not carrie her on horsebacke to heare another preach
shee will goe as far on foote to heare her selfe pray." "<i>She doubts,
etc.</i>" "Scruples." "Shee dareth not give a penny to a beggar for feare he

and applauds herselfe for a noble woman of Berea," after "<i>comes home</i>."
After "<i>gossippings</i>," "unlesse to exercises." After "<i>sampler</i>," "save
that once a year she workes a black-wrought night-cap for some reverend
good man to weare, because it is against the cannon, and then she thinkes
him a bishop's fellow." After "<i>weapons</i>" (weapon), "is the Practice of
Piety, or else shee is armed with the sixt to the Ephesians." For "the
Brownist" read "thinks that Amsterdam is erroneous."</p>


<p class='center'>THE WEAK MAN.</p>

<p>In the Bright MS. there are some important additions and variations in
"<i>The Weak Man</i>." After the words "his brain stays behind," it goes on "He
is for wit as your young travellers for languages, as much as will call
for necessities and hardly that. He is not crafty enough to be a knave,
nor wise enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span> to be honest, but the midway betwixt; a kind of harmless
man. His whole vice is his indiscretion, and yet this makes him seem
guilty of all." After the word "reserved" in Bliss, the MS. goes on: "He
will part with anything in a humour, but in a good cause with nothing, and
you may better entice him than persuade him. He is often perverse, never
resolute and inexorable to nothing so much as reason. He loves wits and
scholars to his cost, for he never has their company but invited. His
friendships commonly are begun in a supper and lost in lending money. The
way to gain his regard is to neglect him, for if he once be in good
estimation, he grows proud upon it and contemns you." After the words
"laid to his charge." "He puts in his verdict at all discourses, and
whatsoever reason you urge, he holds his conclusion." Again, after the
words "breaks forth with all." "His fear is his most violent persuader,
which makes him do more upon the authority of one he hates, than the suit
of his friend. He is one not to live in this world, for each man is his
ambush, and his friend to abuse him. He has been long in contempt, and at
last out of money, and then men cry 'alas!' and forget him."</p>


<p class='center'>A SCEPTICK IN RELIGION.</p>

<p>P. 99. This Character also is so varied from the printed copies in the
Bright MS. that it is given from the latter entire. "He is defined by a
genus without a difference; for he is a Christian at large, and no more.
He uses the land's religion because it is next him; yet he sees not why he
may not take the other yet he chooses this not as better, but because
there is not a pin to choose. He is wondrous loth to hazard his credulity,
and whilst he fears to believe amiss, believes nothing. The opinion of an
over judgment wrongs him, which makes him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span> too wise for the truth. He
finds doubts and scruples better than resolves them, and has always some
argument to nonplus himself. The least religion is enough to perplex him,
and the best will not satisfy him. He hammers too much in general upon our
opinion's incertainty, and the possibility of erring makes him not venture
on what is true. He cannot drive into his fancy the circumscription of
religion into our corner, and yet, the absurdity of Popery staggers him
again. He could like the Protestant better were it not for the puritan,
and the papist but for the Jesuit. He thinks we are more rational, and
likes the life of the other. He thinks so many wise men would not believe
but on good ground, and so many honest men cannot be on the wrong side;
yet he sees not their reason notwithstanding, nor assents to their honesty
without it. He is taken with their miracles yet doubts an imposture; he
conceives of our doctrine better, yet it seems too empty and naked. He
prefers their charity, and commends our zeal, yet suspects that for
blindness, and this but humour. He sees rather what to fly than to follow,
and wishes there were no sides that he might take one. He will sometimes
propend to us upon the reading a good writer, and at Bellarmine recoils as
far back again; and the fathers justle him from one side to another. His
conscience interposes itself betwixt two duellers, and whilst it would
part both, is by both wounded. He hates authority as the tyrant of reason,
and you cannot anger him worse than with a Luther or Calvin's dixit, yet
that wise men are not persuaded with reason, shall authorize his doubt. In
sum, his whole life is a question, and his salvation a greater, wherein he
is so long a disputing, till death make the conclusion, and then he is
resolved."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'>A GALLANT.</p>

<p>P. 57. (<i>In the Bodleian, 2699, E. 21.</i>) [This version is almost identical
with that in the Durham MS. till the last few sentences.] The variations
between the printed copy and Dr. Bright's MS. are so considerable, that
the latter text is here given entire. "A Gallant is a heavy loader of
himself, for he lays more upon his back than it is able to bear, and so at
last breaks it. His first care is his clothes, and the next his body, and
in the uniting of these two lyes his judgment. He is no singular man, for
he is altogether in the fashion, and his very look and beard are squared
to a figure conformable. His face and his boot are ruffled much alike, and
he takes great delight in his walk to hear his spurs gingle. Though his
life pass somewhat slidingly, yet he seems very carefull of the tyme, for
he is always drawing his watch out of his pocket, and spends part of his
hours in numbering them. His chiefest toil is how to spin out the day, and
get a match for cards or the bowl alley, and his worst companion is
himself, for then he is desperate and knows not what to do. The labour of
doing nothing had made him long since weary of his life, if tobacco and
drink did not out of charity employ him. He is furnished with jests, as
some wanderer with sermons, some three for all companies, and when these
are expired, his discourse survives in oaths and laughter. He addresses
himself to ladies with the wagging of his lock, and complements like
Euphues or the knights of the Sun; yet his phrase is the worst apparalled
thing about him, for it is plain fustian.<a name="FNanchor_ED_232" id="FNanchor_ED_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_ED_232" class="fnanchor">[ED]</a> His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span> thigh is always well
apointed with a rapier, yet peaceable enough, and makes<a name="FNanchor_EE_233" id="FNanchor_EE_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_EE_233" class="fnanchor">[EE]</a> a wound in
nothing but the scabard, yet<a name="FNanchor_EF_234" id="FNanchor_EF_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_EF_234" class="fnanchor">[EF]</a> rather than point the field, hee'l pull
it out in the street. He is weaponed rather in the street, than the
highway, for he fears not a thief, but a serjeant. His clothes and himself
grow stale together, and the last act of his life is invisible, for he is
buried commonly before he dies, in the jail or the<a name="FNanchor_EG_235" id="FNanchor_EG_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_EG_235" class="fnanchor">[EG]</a> country."</p>


<p>The following Character may serve as an illustrative commentary on part of
Earle's character of an Attorney.</p>


<p class='center'>THE CHARACTER OF AN ATTORNEY.</p>

<p>P. 211. (<i>From a MS. in the Bodleian, Sheldon Papers</i>), circa 1642. An MS.
Notebook of Bliss's in my possession, containing some 50 pages filled with
the titles of books of characters, has this one among them, in 17th
century hand-writing (pasted on to the page). When this was acquired he
does not say. "An Atturney is a Broker at Law for hee sels wordes and
counsell at the second hand, studies but one language that hee may not bee
thought double tonged, and when vpon necessitie hee reades Latin, 'tis
with a quaking hast soe feare fully you wold thinke him a fellon at his
miserere. Hee speakes nothing but reports, statutes and obligations, and
'tis to bee thought wooes soe too; Lady I hold of you in capite and was by
the fates enacted yours in decimo of the Ringe; his prayers are
sol&#339;cismes for peace, and yet for contention; hee beleeues in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Littleton or the present Cheefe-Justice and against this fayth hee thinkes
the Chancery H&#339;erticall, especially if he speake in a Rocket; his
degrees are to proceed either a Court-keeper or an Under-shrieue and then
a Judges nod qualifies him; hee may hold two or three Clyents the more; to
conclude hee is a very noune adiectiue whom noe man dares trust to stand
by himselfe, but requires a Counsellour to bee ioyned with him."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Deane</span>.</p>


<p class='center'>TWO LETTERS OF EARLE'S.</p>

<p class='center'>[TANNER MS., vol. 48, No. 46.]</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'>Sarum&#785; Sept. 25. 1662.</p>
<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span></p>

<p>"I recyvd your Lordshipp's letter this day from my Lord of
Sarum and give you my most humble and harty thankes for the
great favour you intended me, as likewise for your good
opinion of me! as well as your affection, that you thinke me
capable of such a place in the Church. But my Lord I that
understand my self better, though all things els worse, then
any other frend, find those causes within me why I should
not accept this offer, that I can no way answer, but must
absolutely decline it. Your Lordshipp may remember when you
were pleas'd to propose it to me before the last Bishop had
it, what I said to you then, how unfitted I was for it in
many respects. The same reasons hold good still and the
rather, as I am now both elder and infirmer, and I am afraid
more desperately so, then I beleevd my self to be at that
time. When I come to London, as I hope to doe with in little
more then a fortnight, I shall satisfy you more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
particularly, as I conceyve I have done already my Lord of
Sarum&#785;, whose judgement as I should submitt to assoone as
any mans, and sooner then my owne if it were different from
mine. So I am more confirm'd in my owne opinion, when I find
it conformable to his, being satisfyed with these reasons I
had to refuse it. Seriously if I thought I could doe that
service to the Church, which many hundreds could not doe
better, I would preferre the doing it with trouble before
any ease or convenience of my owne but in the condition that
I am, and the many imperfections upon me, I do not speak it
modestly, I cannot have such a thought. I am hartily sorry
for the death of that Bishop,<a name="FNanchor_EH_236" id="FNanchor_EH_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_EH_236" class="fnanchor">[EH]</a> he was a man of excellent
parts and though there was something to be desired in him,
yett take him alltogether he was both able and likely to
good service in that place which I pray God may loose
nothing by his successor!</p>

<p>My Lord I beseech your Lordship to present my most humble
duty and thankes to my gracious Master, the thinking me
worthy of such a preferment, and that frankness and kindness
which you speak of in his expressing it, was worth to me a
great deale more then any thing els he could give me. I pray
for him daylie, and most hartily, as I doe likewise for your
Lordship to whom I am a moste affectionate servant</p>

Bliss, in his account of the editions, speaks of the 6th edition (1633) as
having two <i>additional</i> Characters, one of them being "The Herald." The
edition of 1630, also called "the 6th edition augmented," I possess. It
contains seventy-six characters (numbered as seventy-seven by mistake),
but neither of the two "additional ones." Bliss's knowledge of editions,
as well as his acquisition of them was increased largely in the years that
followed the publication of his book. When he had acquired the 1st edition
he wrote pathetically in his annotated copy, "I have been more than fifty
years looking for this book!" By that time too he knew that what he here
calls the <i>2nd</i> edition of 1629 was really the <i>fifth</i>. (See <i>Arber's
Reprint</i>, where a table of the editions is given.)</p></div>

<p class='center'>LETTERS OF CLARENDON TO EARLE, A.D. 1647.</p>

<p class='center'>SIR EDWARD HYDE TO DR. JOHN EARLES.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Sir,</p>

<p>"Though I believe you have received two or three letters
from me since you writ any, yet since your's of your new
year's eve came to my hands since I writ last, I reckon it
my turn to write againe; and shall either convert you to a
more sedulous correspondence, or make you so much ashamed
(which is a modesty lazy men are very inclinable to), that
you shall give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span> over writing at all. I always send you word
of the date of those which I receive from you, so that you
can only tell whether I have had that which you say was
pretty long and troublesome; for I have not thought any one
half long enough, nor troublesome; otherwise than (which on
my conscience was not your sense) under the notion of the
vile caracters, which is almost cipher without a key:
besides that commonly the ink and paper do so throughly
incorporate, that the letters are hardly discernable. It is
possible the Scots may take their money, if the other will
pay it; but if upon that consideration they leave the
Kingdom, or suffer the King to leave them, I will no more
pretend to divination. Let not those apprehensions startle
you nor be troubled that they seem sometimes to make
Propositions which you do not like; it being safe and
profitable to them to offer anything which they foresee must
be denied by their jealous brethren. Look upon their
Covenant, their avowed gloss upon that Covenant published to
the world, and tell me if any contradications in Philosophy
be more diametrically opposite and impossible to be
reconciled to the ends of the Independents than those
extremes. I wish I were as sure that the King would not
desert himself and his pious and honourable principles (of
which, truly I have a great confidence) as that the Scots
will stick to him, when they are fully convinced that he is
not to be removed.</p>

<p>"Must I believe <i>H. Cressy's</i><a name="FNanchor_EN_242" id="FNanchor_EN_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_EN_242" class="fnanchor">[EN]</a> resolution to be
peremptory whilst he remains in such company? Truly I am
exceedingly troubled for it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>"What scruples or scandals could work this odious alteration
(for methinks, apostacy is too cholerick a word towards a
friend) which you could not remove? It is a great loss to
the Church, but a greater to his friends, dead and alive;
for the dead suffer where their memory and reputation is
objected to question and reproach.</p>

<p>"Is it a necessary consequence to the conscience, that if a
man turn to that Church, he must take orders in it? Methinks
there is a duty incumbent to the function, that might well
terrify a man that feels not a very strong impulsion, though
he were never so well satisfied in the religion itself.</p>

<p>"If we can not keep him a Minister of our Church, I wish he
would continue a layman in their's, which would somewhat
lessen the defection, and it may be, preserve a <i>greater
proportion of his innocence</i>.</p>

<p>"I am very glad (for my own sake) that you have the
happiness to be known to my Lord Newcastle. I commit the
managing what concerns me, both in substance and
circumstance, wholly to your direction and dexterity: I told
you how far I was advanced by my Lord Withrington. I pray
remember my service to Mr. Hobbs by the same token that
Sydney Godolphin hath left to him by his Will, a legacy of
&pound;200, and desire him for old aquaintance sake, and for your
intercession, to bestow one of his books upon me, which I
have never seen since it was printed, and therefore know not
how much it is the same, which I had the favour to read in
English. I thank you for your wishing your self here. I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
sure I would purchase you at any price I could pay or
promise, if it were as fit for the prince, as it would be
for me. In the mean time I pray God he thinks your company
as good as they know it to be who cannot get it. But will
the good Bishop of Salisbury never come to relieve you? What
does he? Where is he? What do you answer to the other
thousand questions I have asked you?</p>

<p>"God send you a good New Year that may yield you a decent
plenty, till it may give you an honest peace, and me meat
enough against hunger, and cloathes enough against cold.</p>

<p>"And then if the Stationers do not sue out a commission of
Bankruptcy against me for their arrears for paper and ink, I
shall not fear any other creditors, nor the exception in the
first where I will not give my place for the best amongst
the compounders, nor the worst (that is the greatest)
amongst the committee: less the title of being.</p>

<p class='right'>Sir, yours, etc."</p>
<p>"Jersey, the 1st of January."<br />
A Copy of Mr. Edgeman, 1646-1649.</p></div>


<p class='center'>SIR EDWARD HYDE TO DR. JOHN EARLES.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Well, admit you do spend three hours every day, that you
may spend one with the prince, allow two hours to your
dinner, and two hours in the projecting where to get one,
you have still a fair time to yourself, and one half hour in
a week, without question, to tell me that you are alive, and
that in this dismal time of mutation, you are so far from
change, that you continue even the same to me.</p>

<p>"I am not willing to tell you, that though you owe me no
letters, you have three or four of mine unanswered, but I
must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span> tell you the last packet from Paris brought me none
from you though I found by some I received, that mine
thither had not miscarried; so you were not without
provocation.</p>

<p>"Indeed you are to blame to trust me so much with myself in
this terrible conflict; with which most men are so
unworthily appalled: for truly your advice and approbation
is of singular comfort and encouragement to me. And now I
pray tell me what is that '<i>Charitas Patriae</i>' which all
moral and divine authors have so much magnified. That I must
not concur in the acts of impiety and injustice of my
country, though never so generally practised, or do a thing
in itself wicked to save or preserve my country from any
suffering, is I doubt not very clear. But is that Charitas
Patri&aelig; utterly to be abolished and extinguished, for its
practise of that impiety and injustice? Should I wish their
irreligion destroyed by an army of Turks, or their licence
subdued by a power that would make them slaves? Was it well
said of Alcibiades, that he is truly a lover of his country,
not that refuseth to invade the country he hath wrongfully
lost but desires so much to be in it, as by any means he can
he will attempt to recover it? Was not Jocasta more
Christian to her Son Polynices; <i>Petendo patriam perdis; ut
fiat tua, vis esse nullam</i>.</p>

<p>"I pray, say somewhat to me of this argument; that I may
really know how far I may comply with passion and

prince can warrant or excuse my declension of allegiance
towards him, there be not some candour and kindness to
remain towards a man's country, though infected with the
most raging rebellion."</p>

<p class='center'>SIR EDWARD HYDE TO DR. JOHN EARLES.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I told you long since that when I came to speak of that
unhappy battle of Newbury, I would enlarge upon the memory
of our dear friend that perished there: to which I concieve
myself obliged, not more by the rights of friendship than of
history, which ought to transmit the virtue of excellent
persons to posterity: and therefore I am careful to do
justice to every man that hath fallen in the quarrel, on
which side soever, as you will find by what I have said of
Mr. Hambden himself.</p>

<p>"I am now past that point, and being quickened by your most
elegant and (<a name="FNanchor_EO_243" id="FNanchor_EO_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_EO_243" class="fnanchor">[EO]</a>political) commemoration of him and from
hints there, thinking it necessary to say somewhat for his
vindication in such particulars as may possibly have made
impression in good men, it may be I have insisted longer
upon the argument than may be agreeable to the rules to be
observed in such a work, though it be not much longer than
Livy is in recollecting the virtues of one of the Scipio's
after his death. I wish it were with you that you might read
it, for if you thought it unproportionable for the place
where it is I could be willingly diverted to make it a piece
by itself, and inlarge it into the whole size of his life;
and that way it would sooner be communicated to the world.
And you know Tacitus published the life of Julius Agricola
before either his annals or his history.</p>

<p>"I am contented you should laugh at me for a fop in talking
of Livy and Tacitus; when all I can hope for is to side
Hollingshead, and Stow, or (because he is a poor knight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
too, and worse than either of them) Sir Richard Baker. But
if I had not hooked them in this way, how should I have been
able to tell you, that I have this year read over Livy and
Tacitus; which will never be found by the language and less
by the Latin. We have had no boat out of Normandy these ten
days, so that we have heard nothing from the Isle of Wight
since the Kings first message thence. God send us good news
that we may again (in what condition soever) enjoy one
another; which will be a very great satisfaction to; your
most affectionate humble servant."</p>

<p>"Jersey this 14 Dec. St. vet."</p>

<p>A Copy, endorsed by himself.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There are two very long letters of Feb. 12th and March 16th, 1647&mdash;too
long to quote in full&mdash;from which I have thought it worth while to make
extracts.</p>

<p>Concerning the subject of the Charitas Patri&aelig;, "I cannot" he says,
"rejoice at foreign powers being at peace" that there might be "forces
vacant for the reduction of England,"&mdash;but he appeals to Earle for "advice
and direction; upon whose judgment, discretion, and conscience I do so
much depend that I do really suspect my own when I find it at all differ
from yours." He speaks too of Earle's company being so comforting to his
fellow-exiles. Jersey Feb. 12th.</p>

<p>In the letter of March 16th, speaking of possible deterioration of
character&mdash;of "innocence destroyed," of "wiping out the old loved prints,"
he adds that the "shame of communicating his thoughts" to Earle [in case
of his (the writer's) falling away] will, he hopes, keep him from any
"alteration." In the same letter there is another reference to what Earle
had written about Lord Falkland&mdash;no such work I understand survives&mdash;"I
would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span> desire you at your leisure to send me that discourse of your own
which you read to me in the end of your <i>Contemplations upon the Proverbs</i>
in memory of my Lord Falkland: of whom, in its place, I intend to speak
largely&mdash;"so far from being an indecorum (it will be) no less the business
of history than the truth of things."</p>

<p>Anthony Wood's opinion [Bliss's reference to Wood is very brief] of Earle
may be added to Clarendon's testimonies: "This Dr. Earl was a <a name="FNanchor_EP_244" id="FNanchor_EP_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_EP_244" class="fnanchor">[EP]</a><i>very
genteel man</i>, a contemner of the world, religious, and most worthy of the
office of a Bishop." He is elsewhere styled by him "learned and
godly,"&mdash;but the epithet "genteel" gives an extra touch that we should be
loth to lose. In reference to his Latin Translation of Hooker's
Ecclesiastical Polity he adds: "He was only the fit man to make the
learned of all nations happy." Of the Hortus Mertonensis he tells us that
it was one "of several copies of his ingenuity and poetry that were
greedily gathered up" at the University.</p>

<p>I have said in the Preface that nothing is known to Earle's disparagement.
It is true that Ludlow says<a name="FNanchor_EQ_245" id="FNanchor_EQ_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_EQ_245" class="fnanchor">[EQ]</a>: "Dr. Earle told me that by abolishing
episcopacy we took away all the encouragement to learning; for that men
would not send their sons to the University had they not some hopes that
they would attain preferment." And he is very severe on "this sordid
principle and consideration." That it was not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span> recommendation of
learning to Earle is abundantly proved by the Microcosmography&mdash;but he
might well think the University ought not to lose the advantage of any
material inducements such as might appeal to ordinary men.</p>

<p>Earle, moreover, was a humourist, and may have amused himself with
arguments which seemed good enough for his audience. Lord Macaulay must
not be supposed indifferent to learning because he told his nephew to "get
a good degree at College and become a Fellow&mdash;<i>for then</i> he would have
almonds and raisins for the rest of his life for nothing!"</p>

<p>My interleaved copy of Bliss has on the fly-leaf the words "the castrated
title and leaf are preserved, with the addition of a proof title page with
Dr. Bliss's name omitted." The copy is announced in a catalogue slip
pasted in at the end of the book as containing<a name="FNanchor_ER_246" id="FNanchor_ER_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_ER_246" class="fnanchor">[ER]</a> MS. notes by Joseph
Haslewood and Dr. Bliss. The words above the title&mdash;Ex dono <i>editoris</i>
(altered to <i>impressoris</i>)&mdash;have the initials J. H. below them. There are
also three advertisements of Bliss's book, "published this day," two of
them on coloured paper pasted in the beginning; the third is supplemented
by a notice from the Monthly Review, Feb. 1812, which runs as
follows:&mdash;"We recommend the perusal of this work to every class of
readers, since it is in truth a store house of wit and wisdom ... The old
fashioned dress in which these acute strictures on human life appear,
while it takes little or nothing from their intelligibility, adds much to
their force and liveliness. The lovers of proverbial wit, for many of
these characters are strings of judicious adages, are therefore greatly
obliged to Mr. Bliss for his pleasing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span> republication of so pregnant a
volume. The notes are instructive without prolixity: the index is
extremely useful, for it is really astonishing<a name="FNanchor_ES_247" id="FNanchor_ES_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_ES_247" class="fnanchor">[ES]</a> <i>how large a quantity
of good matter</i> is scattered up and down the present <i>duodecimo</i> (the
advt. calls it <i>octavo</i>), and the appendix contains an ample store of
black-letter information, and will introduce almost every reader to some
new acquaintances, who have singularity at least, if nothing else to
recommend them. The Life of the Bishop, and the list of his works are
particularly interesting."</p>

<p>All readers of Cowper will remember what a weight of authority the
criticism of the Monthly Review carried with it, and the pathetic appeal
of the Author to the Editor&mdash;"but oh!, dear Mr. Griffith, let me pass for
a genius at Olney."<a name="FNanchor_ET_248" id="FNanchor_ET_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_ET_248" class="fnanchor">[ET]</a></p>

<p>The notes and illustrations which Dr. Bliss did <i>not</i> make use of in his
edition are as follows.<a name="FNanchor_EU_249" id="FNanchor_EU_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_EU_249" class="fnanchor">[EU]</a></p>

<p>"Dr. Johnson explains querpo, which he says is corrupted from cuerpo
(Spanish), as a dress close to the body. Dryden uses it."</p>

<p>On the same character he has a quotation from Religio Regis, 12mo, 1715:
King James in his advice to his son Henry, Prince of Wales, says "hawking
is not to be condemned, but nevertheless, give me leave to say, it is more
uncertain than the others (hunting), and subject to mischances."</p>

<p>On the "She-precise Hypocrite" he has a note&mdash;on "Geneva."</p>

</div></div>

<p>On 'door-posts' in 'The Aldermen' he quotes, "a pair of such brothers were
fitter for posts without dore indeed, to make a shew at a new-chosen
magistrate's gate."&mdash;<i>The Widow</i>, 4to, 1652.</p>

<p>Of 'Paul's Walk' there is yet one more illustration. "Walk in the middle
Ile in Paul's, and gentlemen's teeth walk not faster at ordinaries than
there a whole day togeather about inquirie after newes."&mdash;Theeves falling
out true men come by their good, or the Belman wanted a clapper, <i>4to,
Lond., 1615.</i></p>

<p>On the Pot-Poet he has a quotation from <i>Whimzies, a new cast of
Characters</i>, 8vo, Lond., 1633, an illustration of the "<i>strange monster
out of Germany</i>." "Nor comes his invention farre short of his imagination:
for want of truer relations, for a neede he can find a Sussex dragone,
some sea or Inland monster, drawn out by some Shoe Lane man in a
gorgon-like feature, to enforce more horror in the beholder."</p>

<p>At the end of the Characters there is an extract from a letter of
Clarendon which mentions that the deanery of Westminster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span> "was designed to
a person of very known and confessed merit," (most probably Dr. John
Earle) <i>written below</i>. He quotes Anthony Wood on the other side of this
leaf for Earle's friendships, with Henry Cary, first Earle of
Monmouth&mdash;with George Morley, afterwards Bishop of Winchester. Morley and
Earle lived together at Antwerp till they were called to attend on the
Duke of York in France. Two passages of Anthony Wood, which he does not
quote, are worth recalling. Morley was sent by Charles II. to "thank
Salmasius for his Apology for his Martyrd father, but not with a purse of
gold as Joh. Milton, the impudent lyer, reported." Henry Cary was "well
skill'd in the modern languages, and a general scholar"; and thus "was
capacitated [by a forced retiredness in the troublesome times of
Rebellion] to exercise himself in studies, while others of the nobility
were fain to truckle to their inferiors for company sake."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><span class="smcap">F. Madan</span>, <i>Sub-Librarian Bodleian Library</i>,</p>
<p class='right'><i>February 11th, 1897.</i></p>

<p>This table was compiled for me most kindly by Mr. <span class="smcap">Madan</span>. It answers the
question, what editions Bliss knew of at <i>various times</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>The following passage from Evelyn's Diary adds one more testimony to
Earle. <i>Nov. 30th, 1662.</i> "Invited by the Deane of Westminster (Dr. Earle)
to his consecration dinner and ceremony on his being made Bishop of
Worcester. Dr. Bolton preached in the Abbey Church&mdash;then followed the
consecration.... After this was one of the most plentiful and magnificent
dinners that in my life I ever saw. It cost neere &pound;600.... Here were the
Judges, Nobility, Clergy, and gentlemen innumerable, this Bishop being
universally belov'd for his sweete and gentle disposition. He was author
of those characters which go under the name of Blount. He translated his
late Majesty's Icon into Latine, was Clerk of his Closet, Chaplaine, Deane
of Westminster, and yet a most humble, meeke, but cheerful man, an
<i>excellent scholar</i>,<a name="FNanchor_EY_253" id="FNanchor_EY_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_EY_253" class="fnanchor">[EY]</a> and rare preacher. I had the honour to be loved
by him. He married me at Paris, during his Majesties and the Churches
exile. When I tooke leave of him he brought me to the Cloysters in his
episcopal habit." He elsewhere speaks of "going to St. Germans to desire
of Dr. Earle," then in attendance at the Prince of Wales' Court, that he
would marry him "at the chapel of his Majesty's Resident at the Court of
France," June 10th, 1647. A sermon of Earle's, "my deare friend now Deane
of Westminster" is mentioned on Christmas Day 1660. It was one "condoling
the breache<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span> made in the public joy by the lamented death of the Princess
of Orange." My attention was drawn to these passages by a friend who
claims descent from Bishop Earle&mdash;Mr. W. B. Alt, of New College, Oxford.</p>

<p>A testimony from another <i>hand</i><a name="FNanchor_EZ_254" id="FNanchor_EZ_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_EZ_254" class="fnanchor">[EZ]</a> is quoted in Bliss's annotated copy.
"How well he understood the world in his younger days appears by his smart
characters; how little he valued it was seen in the careless indifference
of his holy contemplative life."</p>

<p>In Burnet's History of his own Times we are told that Charles II. "who had
a secret pleasure in finding out anything that lessened a man esteemed
eminent for piety, yet had a value for him (Earle) beyond all the men of
his order." (See Arber's Reprint.) On the other hand the Parliament in
1645 had named him as one to be summoned to the Assembly of Divines, but
he declined to come.<a name="FNanchor_FA_255" id="FNanchor_FA_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_FA_255" class="fnanchor">[FA]</a></p>

<p>In 1654 there was printed at the Hague an Elzevir volume&mdash;"morum
exemplar," <i>Latin</i> characters by one Louis du Moulin. He aspires he says
in the preface to be the Virgil or Seneca to Earle's Theocritus or
Menander.</p>

<p>This is his testimony to the characters.</p>

<p>"Et sane salivam primum mihi movit vester Earles cujus characteribus, non
puto quicquam exstare vel severius ubi seria tractat, vel festivius quands
<i>innoxie</i> jocatur: ant pictorem unquam penicillo propius ad nativam
speciem expressisse hominis vultus, quam ille ejus mores patria lingua
descripserit."</p>

<p>It may be of interest to mention in connection with the title<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span> of Earle's
book that the phrase of Menenius Agrippa in Coriolanus.&mdash;"The <i>Map</i> of my
Microcosm" actually occurs as a title of a book of characters by H.
Broune, 1642, the alternative description being "a morall description of
man newly compiled into Essays.</p>

<p>Bliss's MS. book illustrates what I have said in the preface of the change
in the character-sketch. The essay and the pamphlet gradually usurp the
place of social studies. The great mass of the "characters" of the last
half of the seventeenth century are political or religious. On the other
hand, while the only <i>prose</i> character in Bliss of the sixteenth century
deals with the criminal classes, "a discoverie of ten English leapers
verie noisome and hurtfull to the Church and Commonwealth," quoted in his
MS. notebook, mixes such characters with "the Simoniacke," "the murmurer,"
"the covetous man." The date is 1592. (The Tincker of Torvey (1630) also
exhibits this mixture.)</p>

<p>It may be worth while to add a few titles of books of characters, as
illustrating the range of this class of literature, or as being in
themselves interesting. They are from Bliss's own notes in his own copy of
his book or in the MS. note book before referred to.</p>

<p>2. Also a character of coffee and coffee-houses. "It was first brought
into England when the palats of the English were as fanaticall as their
brains.... The Englishman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span> will be a la mode de France. With the barbarous
Indian he smooks tobacco: with the Turk he drinks coffee."</p>

<p>3. News from the new Exchange. The commonwealth of ladies. Printed in the
<i>year of women with out Grace</i>, 1650.</p>

<p>4. There are many countries characterized&mdash;Italy, Spain, Holland,
Scotland. 'Holland' is in verse. It bears out Earle's contemptuous
references to the Dutch. It is here called "The offscouring of the British
land."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This indigested vomit of the sea<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>1672. [It will be found among Marvell's satires, but Bliss does not
mention this.]</p>

<p>5. "Scotland characteriz'd: in a letter to a young gentleman to dissuade
him from an intended journey thither, 1701."</p>

<p>6. "The noble cavalier characterized," "&amp; a rebellious caviller
cauterized," 1644 <i>or</i> 5. An answer to Wither's Campo Mus&aelig;. A vigorous
preface says&mdash;"To begin roundly, soundly, and profoundly, the Cavalier is
a gentleman." By John Taylor.</p>

<p>7. Lucifer's Lacky: the true character of a dissembling Brownist, 1641.</p>

<p>8. "The Tincker of Torvey: a scholler, a cobler, a tincker, a smith; with
Bluster, a seaman, travel from Billingsgate to Gravesend." 1650.</p>

<p>9. "The interpreter," 1622, deals with "three principall terms of state&mdash;a
puritan, a Protestant, a papist."</p>

<p>10. "The Joviall Crew; or the Devill turn'd Ranter." 1651.</p>

<p>11. <ins class="greek" title="ta diapheronta">&#964;&#945; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;</ins>; or divine characters, in two parts, will have
an interest for Bristol readers; it is "by that late burning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span> and shining
lamp, Master Samuel Crook, B.D., late Pastor of Wrington in Somerset, who
being dead yet speaketh." 1658.</p>

<p>12. "A character of the Religion and manners of Phanatiques in Generall,"
1660, includes in the list "Seekers and Enthusiasts." The last sounds
strange as <i>a species</i>.</p>

<p>13. "The character of an Ignoramus Doctor," 1681, recalls The
Microcosmography.</p>

<p>14. The captive Captain, or the restrained Cavalier," 1665, also, in part,
suggests Earle. "Of a Prison," "The anatomy of a Jayler," "The lean
Prisoner," "The restrained Cavalier and his melancholy."</p>

<p>15. Bliss also mentions "The character of a learned man," and gives some
choice extracts. "Our sottish and idle enthusiasts are to be reproved who
call learning but a <i>splendidum peccatum</i>." "Alexander commanded his
soldiers neither to damnify Pindarus, the poet, nor any of his family."</p>

<p>16. "A wandering Jew telling fortunes to Englishmen." 1640.</p>

<p>17. "The spiritual navigators bound for the Holy Land." 1615.</p>

<p>18. "The picture of a modern Whig: a dialogue between Whiglove and Double,
at Tom's Coffee-House." 1715.</p>

<p>19. In 1671 "Le vice ridicule" appeared. A sort of translation of Earle's
characters.</p>

<p>20. Pictures of Passions, Fancies, and Affections, poetically deciphered
in variety of characters (no date).</p>

<p>21. Characters of gentlemen that have put in to the Ladies Invention. This
begins&mdash;"A little Beau of the city strain."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>22. Characters of several ingenious designing gentlewomen, who have lately
put in to the Ladies Invention, which is intended to be drawn as soon as
full. (There is no date to either of these.)</p>

<p>One or two extracts may be added from Anthony Wood.</p>

<p>"Lord Falkland, when he became one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's Privy
Chamber, had frequent retirements to Great Tew and sometimes to Oxon, for
the company of and conversation with learned and witty men. William
Chillingworth (author of the Religion of Protestants), Joh. Earle,<a name="FNanchor_FB_256" id="FNanchor_FB_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_FB_256" class="fnanchor">[FB]</a>
Charles Gataker (son of Thomas Gataker [the Editor of Marcus Aurelius] and
Anthony Wood thinks Chaplain to Lord Falkland); Thomas Triplet, a very
witty man of Christ Church; Hugh Cressey, and others.<a name="FNanchor_FC_257" id="FNanchor_FC_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_FC_257" class="fnanchor">[FC]</a> Cressey wrote a
number of theological works, and in one of them occurs the testimony to
Earle given in Bliss."</p>

<p>The saturnine Anthony Wood is amusingly illustrated in two passages from
his notice of Earle. "John Earle received his first being in this vain and
transitory world within the city of York.... His elegy on Beaumont was
printed at the end of the quarto edition of Beaumont's poems&mdash;put out with
a poetical epistle before them, subscribed by a <i>Presbyterian
bookbinder</i>&mdash;afterwards an informer to the Court of Sequestration ... <i>and
a beggar defunct in prison</i>"! In the notice of Morley he tells us that
"his banishment was made less tedious to him by the company of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span> Dr. Joh.
Earle, his dearest friend." It is sad to find that the translation of
Hooker which was "to make the learned of all nations happy" was "utterly
destroyed"&mdash;the loose papers being taken by the servants after Earle's
death "to light their fires or else to put under their bread and pies."
This translation "was Earle's entertainment during a part of his exile at
Cologne." See the Bodleian letters quoted in Arber's Reprint. To that
Reprint I have been much indebted for help of various kinds.</p>

<p>My warmest thanks are due to Professor Rowley, of University College,
Bristol, whom I have constantly consulted while preparing this issue of
Dr. Bliss's edition. If one may be allowed a slight twist of a
Shakspearian phrase, I would say of such help as his&mdash;"Ripeness is all."
It is this quality that makes one at least of Professor Rowley's friends
so grateful and so importunate.</p>

quoted by Bliss. Anthony Wood says of him, "that when he lost his most
beloved Lord Falkland, at Newbury Fight, he travelled as a tutor, and upon
a freight that the Church of England would terminate through the
endeavours of the peevish and restless Presbyterians, began to think of
settling himself in the Church of Rome." He recanted his errors publicly
at Rome in 1646.</p></div>

set against what Clarendon tells us of his "negligence in dress, habit and
mien." Earle can never have been awkward. His courtesy was born with him,
and he can never have needed (like "the downright scholar") "brushing over
with good company."</p></div>

"Pericles" was printed for him in 1609; and the first edition of Marlow's
"Hero and Leander" in 1598 ["printed for Edward Blunt by Adam Islip"
(Philemon Holland's printer)]. Marlow's "First Book of Lucan" (1600) has a
